   <br />
Trustees Unlimited and Non-Executives Unlimited  are joint ventures bringing together <a href="http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/" target="_blank">NCVO</a>, <a href="http://www.bwbllp.com/" target="_blank">Bates Wells Braithwaite (BWB)</a>, and <a href="http://www.russam-gms.co.uk/charities.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Russam GMS</a>. It was established in 2009 to help not for profit organisations recruit high quality trustees in a rigorous and cost effective way. <br />
<br />

BWB is the leading law firm in the Civil Society Sector, NCVO has the pre-eminent reputation as one of the leading umbrella organisations representing the sector and Russam GMS is one of the leading suppliers of interim managers to the Charity/Not for Profit sectors. All three organisations are thought leaders on governance issues.<br />
