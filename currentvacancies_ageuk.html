    <p><strong>About Age UK</strong></p>
    <p><span class="blueheading"><img src="http://www.trustees-unlimited.co.uk/documents/age UK/Logos/Logo.png" width="189" height="96" class="floatleft" />Age UK</span> is a charity and a social enterprise driven by the needs and aspirations of people in later life. Our vision is a world in which older people flourish. </p>
    <p><strong>Local Age UKs are all independent charities, working in a partnership with the national organisation, Age UK, which formed from the merger of Age Concern England and Help the Aged in 2009. </strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Local Age UKs are therefore responsible for their own management and strategic direction, through their own Board of trustees. </em></strong></p>
    <p>      Many local Age UKs across London and the South are in need of trustees who share their passion for enhancing the lives of older people, and also combine necessary skills and experience with local knowledge and understanding. </p>
    <p>      Donate a couple of hours a month and play a key role in improving the lives of older people in your area. Your local Age UK needs you!      </p>
    <p><strong><em>Local Age UKs welcome applications from people of all ages.</em></strong><em></em></p>
    <p><strong>Application process:</strong></p>
    <p>      Candidates are encouraged to visit the websites of the individual local partners for more information, plus review any attached documents/job descriptions. <strong>In every instance</strong>, candidates should send an email referencing the particular Age UK you&rsquo;re interesting in helping in the subject line, along with your comprehensive up-to-date CV and a supporting statement explaining how you believe your skills and experience match the requirements of the role to <a href="mailto:emma.kynoch@russam-gms.co.uk">emma.kynoch@russam-gms.co.uk</a> <br />
      </p>
    <p>We would also be grateful if you could provide us with the details of 2 referees. Referees will not, of course, be contacted without your prior consent and not until the short list stage.</p>
    <p>      The closing date for all applications is <strong>5pm Friday 14th September</strong>. All applications will then be forwarded to the local Age UKs for shortlisting and details of any next steps will follow in due course.</p>

    <p><strong>About Age UK</strong></p>
    <p>Age UK is a charity and a social enterprise driven by the needs and aspirations of people in later life. Our vision is a world in which older people flourish. </p>
    <p><strong>Local Age UKs are all independent charities, working in a partnership with the national organisation, Age UK, which formed from the merger of Age Concern England and Help the Aged in 2009.</strong></p>
    <p>      <em><strong>Local Age UKs are therefore responsible for their own management and strategic direction, through their own Board of trustees. </strong></em><strong></strong></p>
    <p> Many local Age UKs across London and the South are in need of trustees who share their passion for enhancing the lives of older people, and also combine necessary skills and experience with local knowledge and understanding. </p>
    <p> Donate a couple of hours a month and play a key role in improving the lives of older people in your area. Your local Age UK needs you! </p>
    <p><strong><em>Local Age UKs welcome applications from people of all ages.</em></strong><em></em></p>
