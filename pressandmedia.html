              <td><p>The National Council for Voluntary Organisations  (NCVO) and Trustees Unlimited are jointly launching a new programme that  will help senior employees in the private sector become trustees and  non-executives in charities and other organisations with a social or  environmental mission.</p>
                <p>Currently, there are 161,000 registered charities in the UK, with  800,000 staff and over 14 million volunteers and yet an estimated one in  five charitable organisation&rsquo;s has a trustee vacancy on their boards.  Many charities need trustees with leadership and professional skills.</p>
                <p>Launched during Trustees&rsquo; Week, Step on Board is a comprehensive and  tailor-made volunteering programme that will connect business leaders  with communities.</p>
                <p>Companies will benefit from being able to offer their senior  employees a new approach to professional development and at the same  time enhance their corporate social responsibility and sustainability  strategies.</p>
                <p>Encouraging employees to work with charities is also one of the most  effective ways for companies to improve their satisfaction and  engagement levels.</p>
                <p>Through one to one coaching sessions and interactive workshops led by  sector experts, Step on Board will prepare potential trustees to be  &lsquo;board ready&rsquo; from day one. The sessions will enable candidates to grasp  what charities need from trustees quickly, how the sector works, the  role and responsibilities of trustees and the contribution they are  expected to make. Following the programme, candidates will take up  positions on a charity&rsquo;s board or work as a non-executive in the  voluntary sector.</p>
                <p>Richard Williams, Director of Enterprise at NCVO said, &ldquo;Step on Board  has been created in response to increased interest from corporates  looking to engage with charities in more meaningful, impactful and  sustainable ways.</p>
                <p>It offers the chance for them to make a bigger difference and leave a  lasting impact on society. When senior level employees become trustees  they learn new skills, including problem solving and strategic decision  making as well as different ways of working. It can be a highly positive  experience that goes far beyond ordinary management training  programmes.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>By engaging trained Step on Board trustees, charities can complete  inductions more quickly and welcome trustees who are able to make a  valuable contribution from day one.</p>
                <p>Step on Board will benefit both charities and private companies and  promote the cross-sector sharing of skills and experience.  It offers a  more engaging, sustainable and cost-effective form of professional  development than more traditional styles of leadership training.</p>
                <p>As a bespoke service, the programme can be tailored to an  organisation&rsquo;s individual corporate responsibility goals or can be  folded into its existing continuous professional development.</p>
                <p>A four-step programme ensures that prospective trustees are ready to  take on their next challenge and find the role that is right for them.</p>
                <p>Interactive workshops will help to prepare candidates for their work  as a trustee. They will take part in face-to-face diagnostic interviews  to identify their areas of interest and will receive ongoing support to  maximise the benefits to both sides.</p>
                <p>There will be a thorough impact assessment and evaluation to judge the effectiveness of the project.</p>

                  <p>Almost half of charity trustees recognise there are skill gaps on their board, according to a new survey.<br />
                    <br />
                    Missing skills cited by the 47 per cent of trustees reporting gaps  included legal, HR, fundraising, social media, and marketing  communications. Specialist recruiter Trustees Unlimited surveyed around  200 trustees, and found the most desirable characteristic of a good  trustee was contributing to the organisation&rsquo;s performance, with 32 per  cent highlighting this. The next most important was strategic thinking,  followed by being passionate about the cause. <br />
                    <br />
                    Half of trustees  said they saw that their colleagues possessed these qualities, 40 per  cent said they saw these qualities most of the time and one in ten said  they did not see these characteristics in their co-trustees.<br />
                    <br />
                    Forty-four per cent of respondents said their charity undertakes board  member appraisals every year, 10 per cent have appraisals every two  years and 46 per cent were never appraised. Over a third said their  chair was not appraised.<br />
                    <br />
                    Trustees Unlimited chief executive Ian  Joseph said it is commendable that almost half of organisations  recognise where they have skills gaps, but it is &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; that  almost half of trustees are unaware of the skills they are lacking.<br />
                    <br />
                    &ldquo;To be a good trustee takes many skills but also a firm commitment to  the role and the charity cause. It is the responsibility of the chair to  bring out the best in trustees – using their skills in the right way,  ensuring that meetings are run effectively and that everyone makes a  valuable contribution at each meeting,&rdquo; Joseph said.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>11 November 2014 – 47% of trustees recognise there are skills gaps on  their boards and 46% say their charity doesn&rsquo;t appraise the performance  of board members, according to a new survey from Trustees Unlimited, a  specialist in trustee recruitment.</p>
                  <p>Trustees Unlimited surveyed its database of 2,000 trustees in the run  up to Trustees week (10-16 November 2014) to understand more about how  board performance is measured and the contribution trustees make to  enhance their organisation&rsquo;s performance. <br />
                     <br />
                    The skills gaps cited  by the trustees included legal, HR and fundraising as well as social  media and marketing and communications.<br />
                     <br />
                    Less than half (44%)  said their charity undertakes board member appraisals every year, 10%  have appraisals every two years and 46% are never appraised.  Over a  third said their Chair isn&rsquo;t appraised either. Whilst over half of  trustee said their terms of office were three to five years, almost a  third of admitted there were no fixed terms of office for trustees.<br />
                     <br />
                    Despite  recognising skills gaps charities are recruiting new trustees by word  of mouth (16%) and mainly through their own networks (42%). Around a  third use recruitment agencies or job boards and only 8% advertise  vacancies.<br />
                     <br />
                    Ian Joseph, Chief Executive of Trustees Unlimited:  &ldquo;On the one hand it is commendable that almost 50% of organisations  recognise where they have skills gaps, however, it&rsquo;s extraordinary that  almost half of trustees are unaware of the skills they are lacking. It  is also worrying to see that the approach to appraising board  performance is so variable when governance is more important than ever. A  lack of diverse skills on a board is a huge risk. By relying on word of  mouth or using their own networks to recruit trustees, charities are  really limiting their talent pool. Having no fixed terms for trustees  also prevents talent coming through.&rdquo;<br />
                     <br />
                    &ldquo;There is a wealth of  talented people out there who would be interested in becoming a trustee.  However, charities must be more innovative to reach them - using social  media channels and other recruitment methods to attract them. If they  don&rsquo;t, they will get left behind and the skills gaps will widen,&rdquo; he  added.<br />
                     <br />
                    Tesse Akpeki, Onboard Consultant at Bates Wells  Braithwaite added, &ldquo;Recruitment has never been so high on the governance  agenda.  It has to be strategic and smart.  The right people, playing  the right roles at the right time can demonstrate the quality of  leadership the sector needs.&rdquo;<br />
                     <br />
                    According to trustees, the top  skills needed around the boardroom table are leadership, finance and  chairing skills.  The most desirable characteristic of a good trustee is  contributing to the organisation&rsquo;s performance (32%), next important is  strategic thinking and thirdly being passionate about the cause. Half  of trustee said they saw that their colleagues possessed these  qualities, 40% said they saw these qualities most of the time and one in  ten said they did not see these characteristics in their co-trustees.<br />
                     <br />
                    They  also noted some unusual styles of behaviour. Whilst over 70% recognised  the &lsquo;Helpful Person&rsquo; who always offers their time and input, nearly 46%  recognised the &lsquo;Obsessive&rsquo; who pays too much attention to the small  details and 36% the &lsquo;Parsley on the Fish&rsquo; a board member that looks  good, but doesn&rsquo;t do much. There are also many &lsquo;Colonels&rsquo; sat on  Britain&rsquo;s boards, trustees who are excellent at giving direction and  opinions, but not so good at action, and almost a quarter of respondents  said they recognised the &lsquo;Gong Hunter&rsquo;, someone who is only looking for  glory.<br />
                     <br />
                    Ian Joseph concluded: &ldquo;To be a good trustee takes many  skills but also a firm commitment to the role and the charity cause. It  is the responsibility of the Chair to bring out the best in trustees –  using their skills in the right way, ensuring that meetings are run  effectively and that everyone makes a valuable contribution at each  meeting. There is no room for Colonels and Gong Hunters on charity  boards, especially given charities are under ever increasing scrutiny  from the public and from their regulators. Having trustees not up to the  job is simply unacceptable,&rdquo;</p>

                <p> Taking place on 21st October at Mansion House in the City of London, the conference is a must-attend event for current Chairs or those with an interest in becoming a Chair in the future.</p>
                <p>The half-day conference will include three lively debates: Governance and Board Effectiveness; Diversity of Boards; and The Chief Executive &amp; Senior Management Teams (SMT) Relationships, followed by a networking drinks reception.</p>
                <p>The conference will open with a welcoming speech from the Lord Mayor of London, Fiona Woolf CBE, followed by a ‘personal perspective’ from the Lord Mayor’s Consort, Nicholas Woolf who set up the programme a year ago.</p>
                <p>There will be nine expert speakers taking part in the three debates, which will be chaired by Anthony Carey from Mazars LLP, Lord Gus Macdonald from Macquarie Group and Denise Fellows from Cass CCE<br />

All trustees have a significant responsibility, but the Chair has a special role in leading the organisation and ensuring its well-being and development as well as having the primary relationship with the CEO.<br />

                <p>“By attending the conference we hope participants will be much better informed about the challenges of the role, and how to become more effective chairs. We also want to inspire city professionals to become involved as charity trustees and in due course, Chairs. Charities can benefit hugely from the skills and, experience they bring. It is also my opportunity to sum up what has been achieved during the year and to thank everyone who has participated,” adds Mr Woolf.<br />
                  Denise Fellows, Director of Consultancy and Talent Development at the Centre for Charity Effectiveness, Cass Business School, City University London and CEO of Honorary Treasurers Forum said, “As our programme draws to a close this final event promises to be an extremely valuable session for existing Chairs and those considering taking on this crucial role.<br />

                  “I am delighted to be chairing the third debate which will look at the relationships between Chairs, Chief Executives and senior management teams, discussing the challenges in maintaining the boundaries between governance and management. It’s a difficult balancing act but we have a panel of absolute experts and I look forward to a lively and informative session,” adds Ms Fellows.<br />

                  Nicholas Woolf, the Lord Mayor’s Consort<br />
                  The idea for a Lord Mayor’s Charity Leadership Programme reflects Mr Woolf’s personal experience as Chairman or vice-Chairman of four healthcare charities. With few programmes designed specifically for actual or potential charity Chairs, he wanted to fill this gap.<br />

                New guide launched as part Lord Mayor's Charity Leadership Programme aimed at future trustees<br />
                A  new guide entitled 'Bridging the Gap: moving onto to nonprofitboards'  has just launched as part of the legacy support materials from the Lord  Mayor's Charity Leadership programme 2014.</p>
                <p>The free to download guide has been written and produced by Cass  Centre for Charity Effectiveness, Mazars LLP, and Trustees Unlimited,  and is primarily aimed at people working in the private sector who wish  to take up a trusteeship or other volunteer roles in the charity and  nonprofit sector.</p>
                <p>It is also recommended reading for charities who wish to recruit  people from outside the sector to help them learn how best to use the  skills and experience of people, irrespective of their sector  background.</p>
                <p>The guide covers four main areas:</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>• The Sector – context, composition and character<br />
                  • Governance<br />
                  • Culture<br />
                  • How to become a trustee<br />
                  Denise  Fellows, Director and CEO, Consultancy Cass Centre for Charity  Effectiveness, and the guide's editor says:&quot;The culture of the nonprofit  sector is different from that of the private sector. It is not better  or worse, just different, and it is helpful to understand how to  navigate the disparities.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;There are challenges in the world today which require the broad  thinking and understanding that can be gained by putting together the  knowledge and experience of those in all three sectors –public, private  and voluntary. People who can navigate through the different cultures  and sectors will be much better equipped to meet those challenges,&quot;adds  Ms Fellows.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, Chief Executive, Trustees Unlimited has written a chapter  on 'How to become a trustee' entitled 'Know thyself – motivation' that  looks at the most important things someone must consider before taking  on a trusteeship. Joseph says &quot;When thinking about becoming a trustee,  one of the first things to consider is why you want to become a trustee.  Research has shown that reasons are often varied, with one survey of  potential and existing trustees suggesting that there are often mixed  motives, notably 30 per cent keen to learn new skills 30 per cent  passionate about a particular cause.</p>
                <p>&quot;This guide is a useful read for anyone considering a trusteeship as  it gives a succinct overview of the sector, the challenges and what to  expect and could help someone decide if it's the right thing for them to  be taking on. It's crucial that people understand all the implications  and are as prepared as possible, and are doing it for the right  reasons,&quot; adds Mr. Joseph.</p>
                <p>The Lord Mayor's Charity Leadership Programme is a year-long  programme of free event sponsored by Cass Business School, Mazars LLP  and the Macquarie Group Foundation. It is supported by the Association  of Chairs, the City Bridge Trust, Coutts and Trustees Unlimited. It was  devised by the Lord Mayor's Consort, Nicholas Woolf to provide a  leadership programme within the City to increase the number and  effectiveness of charity chairs.</p>
                <p>Nicholas Woolf, The Lord Mayor's Consort said: &quot;I am delighted with  how the programme has been received. We have had some really stimulating  lectures and debates on many pertinent issues –with another debate and a  major conference for Chairs still to come. This important guide is part  of a series of legacy materials which capture some of the expertise and  experience from the programme, providing continued learning for those  working and volunteering in the sector.&quot;</p>
                <p>The next debate will be taking place at Coutts on 18 September,  looking at Social Engagement; focusing on sports, arts and volunteering.  The programme will conclude with a conference for Chairs and city  professionals on 21 October 2014.</p>

                  Trustees Unlimited were tasked with strengthening the board of  WSPA and recruiting several new trustees to its board from around the  world. Here's the story of what happened...</p>
                <p><strong>About World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA)</strong></p>
                <p>WSPA is a well-respected global animal welfare charity with a  reputation for delivering results at the forefront of animal protection.  With offices in 15 countries, an operating budget of over $70 million  and an unparalleled network of more than 1,000 organisations in 156  different countries WSPA makes a powerful, global impact.</p>
                <p>WSPA runs global campaigns on disaster management, stopping the  illegal trade in wild animals and humane and sustainable agriculture to  end the suffering of billions of animals in intensive farming. The  organisation started as a membership organisation in the UK and USA 30  years ago, but it is now a truly global organisation with a new  governance structure.</p>
                <p>Its new strategy is to make animal welfare part of the global  wellbeing debate and bring it more into the public consciousness, much  like environmental and humanitarian charities have done over the past  decade.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The charity is mid-way through implementing a five year strategy and  focusing on delivering real and lasting change not only for the animals,  but for the people who depend on them, which means it needs to engage  at the top tables in both governments and big businesses around the  world.</p>
                <p>To achieve its new goals, WSPA wanted to strengthen its board and  recruit several new trustees to its board from all around the world with  strong experience in promoting higher standards in animal welfare  globally.</p>
                <p><strong>The challenge</strong></p>
                <p>Previously WSPA had recruited people through its own networks, and  mainly from animal charities, but this recruitment and search process  needed to be different and reflect the new organisational structure and  mission.</p>
                <p>Whilst there were trustee boards in place in several countries; the  main International board based in the UK now needed to reflect the  global nature of its work. The charity needed a more diverse group of  international trustees from all walks of life not just animal welfare  organisations, to join the International board. The search began two  years ago and is on-going.</p>
                <p>As Stephen Corri, director of governance and legal services at WSPA  commented: &quot;We wanted to find trustees with experience of working with  large humanitarian or environmental charities that could help us raise  the profile of animal welfare, as these kinds of charities have done in  the past. We also needed people with strong commercial and financial  backgrounds that are able to make change happen from a business  perspective and help us build networks across the world.&quot;</p>
                <p><strong>The recruitment process</strong></p>
                <p>To recruit on such a global scale is a challenge and to find an  organisation flexible enough to be able to do this is also a challenge.</p>
                <p>WSPA met up with several large recruitment firms, as well as Trustees Unlimited.</p>
                <p>Even though Trustees Unlimited hadn't undertaken a big international  search before they were passionate about the project and flexible in  their approach as they moved through the process, so they were selected.</p>
                <p>Stephen Corri commented: &quot;We needed a bespoke recruitment service;  not an 'off-the-shelf' recruitment package that many of the larger  recruitment agencies were offering. This was a unique search with a  unique set of requirements. We also needed the service to be very  cost-effective.</p>
                <p>&quot;Trustees Unlimited offered exactly what we needed, within our budget  and working together we devised a very successful recruitment programme  that has already brought us several great candidates.&quot;</p>
                <p>Olga Johnson, Associate Director at Trustees Unlimited headed up the  search. Olga is well travelled and having been on the board of three  international charities has first-hand experience of what was needed.</p>
                <p>After taking a detailed briefing Olga set about the extensive global  search to find potential candidates outside the UK that could offer the  experience the charity needed to take it forward.</p>
                <p>All of the WSPA trustee roles require significant global strategic  expertise. In the last two years a skills audit of trustees identified a  specific need for a new trustee with strategic finance expertise from  the commercial sector, and another with humanitarian aid expertise.</p>
                <p>An in-depth global search enabled WSPA to recruit three new trustees  in 2012 and 2013 with the above experience. Another search was completed  to identify a trustee with relevant global vetinary and animal welfare  expertise, and for this role Olga focused on three sectors to identify  candidates:</p>
                <p>• International animal welfare voluntary sector including contacts within WSPA<br />
                  • Veterinary colleges and their alumni outside the UK together with veterinary professional membership societies<br />
                  • Veterinary pharmaceutical industry</p>
                <p>Olga Johnson commented: &quot;This is a very unique and long term search  for us, and during the recruitment process I travelled via the web to  China, Thailand, New Zealand, Malaysia, Australia, Nigeria, Ethiopia,  Ghana, Kenya DRC and the US making contact with organisations we felt  could help us find candidates with the right experience and background.</p>
                <p>&quot;By a fortunate coincidence I was able to interview one of the  candidates in Kenya, as I just happened to be on holiday there at the  time. It truly was a global search,&quot; adds Ms Johnson.</p>
                <p><strong>The new trustees</strong></p>
                <p>So far Trustees Unlimited has recruited three trustees with a  combination of humanitarian expertise and commercial and financial  expertise, two of which are overseas. Paul Baldwin, managing director of  HSBC Global Banking and Markets Division in London was recruited first  in 2012.</p>
                <p>This was followed last year by Nesta Hatendi, who is based in Kenya  and is the regional representative for Africa for Help Age  International. Another is Joseph Nhan-O'Reilly who is based in Thailand  and is a senior advisor for Save the Children UK in the Asia region.</p>
                <p>The search for trustees is on-going and, having successfully  completed a global search for a veterinary trustee, Trustees Unlimited  has put forward three more candidates for interview.</p>
                <p>Olga Johnson comments: &quot;This search has so far found three  extraordinary new trustees for WSPA who are already in place; and in the  next few weeks interviews will be taking place for the veterinary  trustee role.It has been a pleasure working with WSPA and I very much  look forward to continuing to look for trustees and completing their  international board.&quot;</p>
                <p>Trustees Unlimited is a joint venture trustee recruitment company set  up by Russam GMS, NCVO and Bates Wells Braithwaite. The company has  seen rapid growth over three years and is working with charities of all  sizes to appoint professional trustees to their boards. Currently one in  five charities has a trustee vacancy on their boards, Trustees  Unlimited has a database of around 1,300 trustees from professional  backgrounds looking for trustee positions.<br />

                <p>Sam Burne James asks experts including Bruce Gordon about the need for a finance expert on a charity board.</p>
                <p>Bruce Gordon, chairman of the Honorary Treasurers Forum, says  bringing private sector finance experience onto the board is not without  its pitfalls.</p>
                <p>Ensuring good financial governance at a charity should be the  responsibility of everyone on the board, not just those trustees with  ACA, FCA or other initials after their names; yet the ball does often  fall into the court of those private sector specialists.</p>
                <p>This is all very well but, as Bruce Gordon, chairman of the Honorary  Treasurers Forum, told the Charity Finance Group annual conference in  May, bringing private sector finance experience onto the board is not  without its pitfalls. Honorary treasurers, he said, often fit one of two  descriptions: the first is the City stereotype – &quot;some bigwig who's  used to running the show&quot;, as Gordon put it; the second is a different  prospect altogether: &quot;a lovely old chap, but he doesn't really know  what's going on – and when the brown stuff hits the rotating object, he  doesn't understand the detail&quot;.</p>

                <p>In private companies, the finance director is the chief executive's  confidant, said Gordon, who is the treasurer of the National Council for  Voluntary Organisations and was a board partner at the financial  services firm Deloitte until 2008. He said a typical example of  businesspeople struggling to get to grips with third sector priorities  was a board meeting at which a new honorary treasurer heard that the  charity had a surplus last year.</p>
                <p>&quot;He says: 'We've got a £5m profit'. Everyone looks at him and says:  'Er, no',&quot; Gordon said. Another issue, he said, was that some honorary  treasurers acted as if they were actually the finance director, and  thought the real one was &quot;a sort of baby FD&quot;.</p>
                <p>Stephen Brooker, a director at the charity board recruitment firm  Trustees Unlimited, agrees that Gordon's words ring true about both  honorary treasurers and broader board-finance team relationships.</p>
                <p>&quot;I think that many people become trustees without knowing clearly  what the role entails,&quot; says Brooker. &quot;To avoid mismatches between  expectations and powers, charities should establish whether the person  is to be treasurer in name or in fact, whether they are expected to  mentor the FD and what exactly is expected of them.&quot;</p>
                <p>Kate Sayer, a partner at the accountancy firm Sayer Vincent, says:  &quot;For treasurers, decision-making in charities can be very different from  the experience they might have had in business. Charity treasurers can  come from all walks of life and – contrary to popular opinion – do not  have to be accountants. The key qualities in a treasurer are a  questioning mind and a readiness to embark on fresh thinking.&quot;</p>
                <p>And a key role of treasurers, whether or not they are accountants, is  to ensure that the other trustees on the board are involved in – and  understand – financial issues, she says.</p>
                <p>But Elizabeth Balgobin, a governance consultant and interim chief  executive of the London Sustainability Exchange, says getting everyone's  attention can be tough.</p>
                <p>&quot;It's one of the trickiest bits of governance, because you don't join  a board to spend three hours looking at the accounts,&quot; she says. &quot;You  join because you've got an interest in the cause.&quot; Expertise can also be  a problem, she says: &quot;It's nigh-on impossible to get trustees to attend  a 'finance for non- finance people' course.&quot;</p>
                <p>However, Anjali Kothari, a partner at the accountancy firm Kingston  Smith, has had a very different experience from that of Balgobin – she  says her firm's twice-yearly 'accounts for non-accountants' training  sessions are always full. &quot;They're the ones in the right position here,&quot;  she says. &quot;They say they don't want to be beholden to the qualified  person on the board.&quot;</p></td>

                <p>A new guide entitled Bridging the Gap: moving onto to nonprofit  boards has just launched as part of the legacy support materials from  the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Charity Leadership programme 2014.</p>
                <p>The free to download guide has been written and produced by Cass  Centre for Charity Effectiveness, Mazars, and Trustees Unlimited, and is  primarily aimed at people working in the private sector who wish to  take up a trusteeship or other volunteer roles in the charity and  nonprofit sector.</p>
                <p>It is also recommended reading for charities who wish to recruit  people from outside the sector to help them learn how best to use the  skills and experience of people, irrespective of their sector  background.</p>
                <p>The guide covers four main areas:</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The Sector – context, composition and character<br />
                  Governance<br />
                  Culture<br />
                  How to become a trustee</p>
                <p>Denise Fellows, director and CEO, Consultancy Cass Centre for Charity  Effectiveness, and the guide&rsquo;s editor, said: &ldquo;The culture of the  nonprofit sector is different from that of the private sector. It is not  better or worse, just different, and it is helpful to understand how to  navigate the disparities.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;There are challenges in the world today which require the broad  thinking and understanding that can be gained by putting together the  knowledge and experience of those in all three sectors – public, private  and voluntary.</p>
                <p>&quot;People who can navigate through the different cultures and sectors will be much better equipped to meet those challenges.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, chief executive, Trustees Unlimited has written a chapter  on &lsquo;How to become a trustee&rsquo; entitled &lsquo;Know thyself – motivation&rsquo; that  looks at the most important things someone must consider before taking  on a trusteeship.</p>
                <p>Joseph said: &ldquo;When thinking about becoming a trustee, one of the  first things to consider is why you want to become a trustee. Research  has shown that reasons are often varied, with one survey of potential  and existing trustees suggesting that there are often mixed motives,  notably 30 per cent keen to learn new skills 30 per cent passionate  about a particular cause.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;This guide is a useful read for anyone considering a trusteeship as  it gives a succinct overview of the sector, the challenges and what to  expect and could help someone decide if it&rsquo;s the right thing for them to  be taking on.</p>
                <p>&quot;It&rsquo;s crucial that people understand all the implications and are as  prepared as possible, and are doing it for the right reasons,&rdquo; adds Mr.  Joseph.</p>

                <p>More professionals could consider a post as a charity Trustee as a way to boosting boardroom diversity, according to Trustees Unlimited.<br />
                  As part of Volunteers' Week 2014, the organisation says the number of people volunteering as trustees has remained static despite more people working in the charity sector. </p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, CEO, Trustees Unlimited and joint Managing Director, Russam GMS said: &ldquo;There are just over 180,000 charities in England and Wales registered with the Charity Commission, and it&rsquo;s estimated that around half have at least one vacancy on their board. With the volunteer sector being called on to provide more services, the need for top talent on charity boards is more pressing than ever. Many young professionals may not have considered trusteeship as a way of volunteering and we hope that by highlighting the benefits and opportunities more of them will consider it this Volunteers&rsquo; Week.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Becoming a trustee can enhance peoples&rsquo; employability and career prospects and provide an opportunity for them to give something back to society. In recent years, we&rsquo;ve seen many more corporates encouraging their high potential employees to become trustees as a part of their ongoing professional development, but there is still a real shortage of talented professionals on charity boards.&rdquo;<br />
                  According to figures from the Charity Commission, the average age of trustees is 57 and two thirds are aged over 50. Some 43% of trustees are female and 56% are male.</p>
                <p>Joseph says: &ldquo;Charities have a big role to play in attracting young professionals. Many are still failing to cast their recruitment net widely enough to attract people with a broad range of skills and experience. Some are guilty of make meetings inaccessible to working professionals and failing to review the performance of trustees regularly or refresh the skills on their boards to make room for new recruits. Another problem is that some charities aren&rsquo;t promoting their vacancies widely enough to attract professional people.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>He added: &ldquo;We hope that this year&rsquo;s Volunteers&rsquo; Week will prompt many professionals to become a trustee. However, they need to be aware of the risks and liabilities involved in trusteeship and undertake due diligence and research into an organisation before they apply for and accept a role.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>A report from think tank Demos[i] last month argued that more bosses should be encouraged to award promotions or pay rises to employees who have volunteered for charities. The research claimed that participation in volunteering schemes can boost employees&rsquo; skills and job satisfaction, and that workers can save their employers thousands of pounds in training costs by the skills they gain helping good causes. 61 per cent of employees questioned by Demos agreed volunteering experience made them perform better in their job whilst two-thirds (66 per cent) saw a noticeable improvement in their communication skills, with negotiating (45 per cennt), team-working (43 per cent) and leadership skills (41 per cent) also enjoying a timely boost. </p>
                <p>The report estimated that British firms spend around £40 billion a year on training, and individual leadership-training courses can cost up to £2,500. In comparison, the average cost per employee of running a volunteer programme is just £381.10 year. </p>
                <p>We believe this is a win-win situation for charities, businesses and employees to volunteer and earlier this month we marked Volunteers Week by calling for more young professionals to become volunteer trustees and to fill gaps at board level. Not only does the charity benefit from their corporate experience and having a more diverse board; the company they work for benefits from them gaining different &lsquo;softer&rsquo; skills such as better communication, leadership and team-working skills, and learning to work with people and organisations outside of their usual sphere.</p>
                <p>Many more of the trustees we are recruiting to charity boards these days are full-time professionals in their 30s and 40s with a range of corporate and business skills that can really boost the performance of a charity. Younger professionals can bring expertise and a different perspective to Britain&rsquo;s boards, which many charities welcome.</p>
                <p>There are more than 180,000 charities in England and Wales registered with the Charity Commission, and it&rsquo;s estimated that around half have at least one vacancy on their board. With the volunteer sector being called on to provide more services, the need for top talent on charity boards is more pressing than ever. Many young professionals may not have considered trusteeship as a way of volunteering, but it can be a great way to enhance employability and career prospects, as well as the opportunity to give something back to society.</p>
                <p>There is also a need for charity boards to become more diverse and attract people from all backgrounds to help improve governance and performance. According to figures from the Charity Commission, just 0.5 per cent of trustees in England and Wales are aged between 18 and 24 (compared with 12 per cent of the population as a whole); the average age of trustees is 57, and two thirds are aged over 50, plus 43.4 per cent of trustees are female and 56 per cent are male.</p>
                <p>Charities themselves, however, have a big role to play to attract young professionals. Many are still failing to cast their recruitment net widely enough to attract people with a broad range of skills and experience. Some are guilty of make meetings inaccessible to working professionals and failing to review the performance of trustees regularly or refresh the skills on their boards to make room for new recruits. Another problem is that some charities aren&rsquo;t promoting their vacancies widely enough to attract professional people.</p>
                <p>This issue was raised by Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts at Russam GMS's annual civil society event held in May. Lord Hodgson said there was a clear link between underperforming charities and boards where trustees had served for five, 10 or even 15 years. He also stressed that if charities hold their meetings at lunchtime, in the middle of the week at the golf club how can they expect to attract professional people. One charity that has recently recruited three mid-career professional trustees is Music of Life, a small charity providing high quality musical education and performance opportunities for children and young people with disabilities and special needs.</p>
                <p>The charity was looking for new trustees, following recent departures, with expertise in marketing and communications, finance and fundraising and ideally experience of working in the fields of disability or education. The trustees chosen were all working professionals – Stephanie Stewart a former charity CEO and Jessica Clark, a lawyer, school governor and already a trustee at Brent Community Law Centre, whose son also has special needs.</p>
                <p>Since being in the roles the chief executive of Music of Life, Maria Teterina has commented that the organisation has already been transformed because of their specialist skills and passion for the cause and the charity is planning ahead with confidence and developing a new strategic plan which she believes they will be able deliver.</p>
                <p>There are huge benefits and rewards to be gained by being a trustee, and it can be a truly life changing experience, however, anyone thinking of taking on the role needs to be aware of the risks and liabilities that come with it; and they should always undertake due diligence and research into an organisation before applying and accepting a trusteeship.</p>
                <p>Below are my tips for people considering a trustee role:</p>
                <p>• Be sure that this is really something you want to do. Do lots of research online about the pros and cons of being a trustee before making a decision</p>
                <p>• Visit the <a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/">http://www.volunteering.org.uk</a> website as there&rsquo;s lots of useful information on how to volunteer</p>
                <p>• Make sure you do your homework and find a charity you feel really passionate about. If you are going to dedicate a lot of time to the charity, you need to feel strongly about it</p>
                <p>• Be aware of the time commitments. Every charity will have different expectations. Make sure you can give it the time it requires but that there is still time available for you to look for full time employment and attend interviews. Don&rsquo;t over commit!</p>

                <p>Setting pay is tricky for trustees and senior managers - there are many factors to weigh up. Setting pay is a tricky task for trustees and senior managers. There are lots of factors to weigh up, and talking about salaries can make many of us uncomfortable. It's especially tough when we know and like the people whose salaries it is our task to set. </p>
                <p>Losing key staff will be high on the risk register for many charities, with even the smoothest of departures having the potential to be seriously disruptive. While new staff can be a boon, replacing valued staff means facing both opportunity costs, in the form of lost contacts and knowledge, and real costs, in recruiting replacements.</p>
                <p>Yet trustees and senior managers will want to use their resources effectively and not pay more than necessary. Your ability to retain your staff is a crucial part of setting pay levels, but it's not the only part. Traditional wisdom says that in setting pay, organisations need to provide a level that will attract, retain and motivate staff. NCVO's pay inquiry took the view that in the voluntary sector, the emphasis should be on &quot;attract and retain&quot;. Staff in the sector should already be motivated. The work we do and the difference we make should see to this. Here are the key steps for getting pay right.</p>
                <p>Establish a remuneration committee</p>
                <p>This should be a common practice at larger organisations and smaller charities could also benefit. A specialist subcommittee of the board can engage in detailed study and discussion. You can also elect external experts to provide insight and an independent viewpoint.</p>
                <p>Whose pay are you setting</p>
                <p>Trustees should usually set the pay of a small, defined group of the most senior managers, and leave them to determine pay for the rest of the staff. Their processes may be separate but both will need to be conscious of the relationship between these groups. A pay rise for senior managers but not staff would be hard to defend, for example. Similarly, any differences in the benefits available to staff and senior managers are likely to diminish collegiality and increase hostility.</p>
                <p>Have a clear pay policy</p>
                <p>This avoids confusion (or worse, resentment) over pay. Your policy should set out how pay is determined and the factors taken into account. The NCVO inquiry recommends that all charities with an income of over £500,000 should have a remuneration policy. Your policy should cover any comparators you aim to benchmark against and how your income, performance and forecasts will affect pay settlements. You should think about your track record in recruitment, retention and performance – are you building on a strong base or do you have problems you need to address?</p>
                <p>Communicate what you do and why</p>
                <p>Both externally and to your staff. The inquiry concluded that individual charities all have a part to play in maintaining trust in the whole sector, by being open about what they pay and why. It recommended charities with an income over £500,000 publish a statement setting out exactly what senior staff are paid, and their charity's approach to setting pay. You should include this in your annual report and somewhere easy to find on your website. Your staff should also be able to understand how their pay and their senior managers' pay is set. A transparent process engenders trust.</p>
                <p>Money can't buy us happiness</p>
                <p>Think about the role of low-cost or non-monetary rewards – these can be more affordable for your organisation yet more valuable to staff. Flexible working, development opportunities, control over their work, volunteering leave, study leave, biscuits, fruit, drinks – there are hundreds of ways to improve your staff's experience of their work and their impression of you as an employer, from the serious to the seemingly trivial. Senior staff will value clear direction from committed trustees who understand their difficulties but continue to challenge them appropriately.

                <p>As Small Charity Week comes to an end - Ian Joseph, CEO, Trustees Unlimited looks at how small charities can attract trustees from the private sector.</p>
                <p>Many charities want to recruit people from the private sector because of the skills and experience they could bring to the board, but too often they end up recruiting from the same old networks, because they don't know how best to market their trustee roles or widen their recruitment net. </p>
                <p>Here are some tips for smaller charities on how to tap into the commercial sector and widen their recruitment scope for trustee positions this year:</p>
                <p>Clear vision of the ideal candidate</p>
                <p>Undertaken an audit of the competencies, knowledge and experience needed for the role and recruit to that brief. Have a clear vision of what your ideal new trustee will be like and what you expect from them. Think about why someone would be interested in volunteering their services with you. You may be passionate about the charity's cause, but can you create a compelling proposition about the role?</p>
                <p>Clarity about the decision making process</p>
                <p>Be clear about who is making the decision. Is it the existing trustees or the membership? This needs to be clear from the start to avoid any surprises later. Have a clear process for informal meetings with the management team and possibly service users, tours of services and interviews. Interviews should be evidence-based to test the candidates' motivation as well as their skills and experience. Make sure you always take verbal references at the interview stage.</p>
                <p>Robust recruitment practices</p>
                <p>Plan the recruitment process properly, scheduling in all activities and making sure those involved in the process are fully briefed. It is crucial to make sure all the trustees are happy with the process even if they are not directly involved in the selection. Recruiting a new trustee can take several weeks so make sure you allow time to do it professionally.</p>
                <p>Clear role description</p>
                <p>Create a clear role description, outlining the roles and responsibilities of being a trustee and whether you expect the person to sit on any sub-committees. Be clear about the expected time commitment and the location and times of meetings. Remember that many people won't understand what trusteeship involves and this can be one of the biggest hurdles. Creating a detailed role description for potential candidates can help overcome this.</p>
                <p>Detailed information pack</p>
                <p>Prepare an information pack for candidates. This should include links to the memorandum and articles of association, the financial accounts, biographies of your trustees and the governance structure, including sub committees and other useful information such as strategic plans.</p>
                <p>Use your current networks</p>
                <p>Tap into your current networks and engage the whole board in the process. Make sure everyone knows there is a trustee vacancy available. However, a word of caution: your existing networks can often result in recruiting in the board's own image to so if possible, extend the search beyond this.</p>
                <p>Advertise the role</p>
                <p>Write a punchy advertisement for your website and distribute it via social media. If you produce a newsletter make sure you include the advert. Think about where the people you want to attract would be likely to see your advert – whether it's a local venue, specialist press, a volunteering website or elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Widening the search</p>
                <p>Be creative and think about other places you could advertise. There are resources available for publicising trustee roles free of charge such as NCVO's Trustee Bank. Contact the HR department of local businesses and see if you could post something on their intranet or in a staff newsletter.</p>
                <p>Use a specialist recruitment firm</p>
                <p>Consider using a professional recruitment firm with a track record of recruiting trustees. They will have a database of executives seeking trustee roles and be able to match candidates to your exact requirements, though beware there will be a cost atatched. Some like Trustees Unlimited offer a cost-effective service based on the size of the organisation.</p>
                <p>Before the new trustee joins</p>
                <p>Once you have found your ideal candidate ensure they receive a good induction to help them settle in quickly. This includes clarity about the mission, plans, objectives and minutes of the last few meetings.</p>
                <p>Translation</p>
                <p>Many from the private sector will not understand the nuances and language of the not-for-profit sector so avoid jargon. Decision making in the not for profit sector often requires a lot of consensus building and this can be a new experience for those in the private sector who are used to a faster pace in reaching decisions; so patience is required.</p>

              <td><p>Businessworks 18th June 2014 - By Ian Joseph, CEO, Trustees Unlimited</p>
                <p>A recent report from think tank Demos last month argued that more bosses should be encouraged to award promotions or pay rises to employees who have volunteered for charities. The research claimed that participation in volunteering schemes can boost employees' skills and job satisfaction and that workers can save their employers thousands of pounds in training costs by the skills they gain helping good causes. 61% of employees questioned by Demos agreed volunteering experience made them perform better in their job whilst two-thirds (66%) saw a noticeable improvement in their communication skills, with negotiating (45%), team-working (43%) and leadership skills (41%) also enjoying a timely boost. </p>
                <p>The report estimated that British firms spend around £40 billion a year on training and individual leadership-training courses can cost up to £2500. In comparison, the average cost per employee of running a volunteer programme is just £381.10 year.</p>
                <p><strong>Better communication, leadership and team-working skills</strong></p>
                <p>We believe this is a win-win situation for charities, businesses and employees to volunteer and earlier this month we marked Volunteers Week by calling for more young professionals to become volunteer trustees and to fill gaps at board level, says Ian Joseph, CEO of Trustees Unlimited. Not only does the charity benefit from their corporate experience and having a more diverse board, the company they work for benefits from them gaining different 'softer' skills such as better communication, leadership and team-working skills, and learning to work with people and organisations outside of their usual sphere.</p>
                <p>Many more of the trustees we are recruiting to charity boards these days are full-time professionals in their 30s and 40s with a range of corporate and business skills that can really boost the performance of a charity. Younger professionals can bring expertise and a different perspective to Britain&rsquo;s boards, which many charities welcome.</p>
                <p>There are just over 180,000 charities in England and Wales registered with the Charity Commission, and it is estimated that around half have at least one vacancy on their board. With the volunteer sector being called on to provide more services, the need for top talent on charity boards is more pressing than ever. Many young professionals may not have considered trusteeship as a way of volunteering, but it can be a great way to enhance employability and career prospects, as well as the opportunity to give something back to society.</p>
                <p>There is also a need for charity boards to become more diverse and attract people from all backgrounds to help improve governance and performance. According to figures from the Charity Commission, just 0.5% of trustees in England and Wales are aged between 18 and 24 (compared with 12% of the population as a whole); the average age of trustees is 57, and two thirds are aged over 50, plus 43.4 of trustees are female and 56% are male.</p>
                <p>Charities themselves, however, have a big role to play to attract young professionals. Many are still failing to cast their recruitment net widely enough to attract people with a broad range of skills and experience. Some are guilty of make meetings inaccessible to working professionals and failing to review the performance of trustees regularly or refresh the skills on their boards to make room for new recruits. Another problem is that some charities aren't promoting their vacancies widely enough to attract professional people.</p>
                <p>This issue was raised by Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts at Russam GMS's annual civil society event held in May. Lord Hodgson said there was a clear link between underperforming charities and boards where trustees had served for 5, 10 or even 15 years. He also stressed that if charities hold their meetings at lunchtime, in the middle of the week at the golf club how can they expect to attract professional people.</p>
                <p>One charity that has recently recruited three mid-career professional trustees is Music of Life, a small charity providing high-quality musical education and performance opportunities for children and young people with disabilities and special needs. The charity was looking for new trustees, following recent departures, with expertise in marketing and communications, finance and fundraising and ideally experience of working in the fields of disability or education.</p>
                <p>The trustees chosen were all working professionals – Stephanie Stewart, a former charity CEO, and Jessica Clark, a lawyer, school governor and already a trustee at Brent Community Law Centre, whose son also has special needs.</p>
                <p>Since being in the roles, the Chief Executive of Music of Life, Maria Teterina, has commented that the organisation has already been transformed because of their specialist skills and passion for the cause and the charity is planning ahead with confidence and developing a new strategic plan which she believes they will be able deliver.</p>
                <p>There are huge benefits and rewards to be gained by being a trustee and it can be a truly life-changing experience, however, anyone thinking of taking on the role needs to be aware of the risks and liabilities that come with it and they should always undertake due diligence and research into an organisation before applying and accepting a trusteeship.</p>
                <p>Below are my tips for people considering a trustee role:</p>
                <p>• Be sure that this is really something you want to do. Do lots of research online about the pros and cons of being a trustee before making a decision;</p>
                <p>• Visit the www.volunteering.org.uk website as there is lots of useful information on how to volunteer;</p>
                <p>• Make sure you do your homework and find a charity you feel really passionate about. If you are going to dedicate a lot of time to the charity, you need to feel strongly about it;</p>
                <p>• Be aware of the time commitments. Every charity will have different expectations. Make sure you can give it the time it requires but that there is still time available for you to look for full-time employment and attend interviews. Don't over commit!</p>

              <td><p>2nd June 2014 - The latest figures from the Charity Commission showed  that the number of charity workers rose by 35,000 in the year to March  2014, with 897,000 people in total employed in the sector. However, the  number of trustees in Britain remained almost static at 947,000.  Trustees Unlimited wants this to change. It is marking Volunteers&rsquo; Week  2014 by calling for more young professionals across Britain to become  charity trustees.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, CEO, Trustees Unlimited and joint Managing Director,  Russam GMS commented, &ldquo;There are just over 180,000 charities in England  and Wales registered with the Charity Commission, and it&rsquo;s estimated  that around half have at least one vacancy on their board.

                <p>&ldquo;Becoming a trustee can enhance peoples&rsquo; employability and career  prospects and provide an opportunity for them to give something back to  society. In recent years, we&rsquo;ve seen many more corporates encouraging  their high potential employees to become trustees as a part of their  ongoing professional development, but there is still a real shortage of  talented professionals on charity boards.&rdquo;</p>

              <td><p>It takes planning and honesty with potential candidates if you want  to recruit diverse trustees with a good balance of skills. Patrick  McCurry canvasses opinion on how to broaden your board.<br />
                <br />
                Making sure a trustee board is fresh and has the right  combination of skills, experience and backgrounds can be a major  challenge for voluntary organisations.<br />
                <br />
                It can be hard to know where to find new board members, outside  the usual personal networks of senior staff or existing trustees. But  the risk in recruiting purely from existing networks is that boards will  not gain diversity and a spread of skills.</p>
                <p>Derek Twine, the former chief executive of the Scout Association and  chair of the charity chief executives body Acevo's recent governance  commission, believes that many charities, especially smaller ones, are  wary about recruiting outside their usual pool of candidates.</p>
                <p>'It's not that they don't want to, but they lack confidence about how  to recruit in a more open way,' he says. 'So they resort to the  'someone I know' syndrome.'</p>
                <p>A key element of the process, he argues, is for a charity's board and  senior people to reflect on how they want the organisation to develop  in the next three to five years. From this process they can draw up a  list of trustee skills and experience that will be needed to support  this plan.<br />
                  <br />
                  Too many charities still fail to insist on getting the right  candidates to join the board, says governance consultant Stella Smith.  'Charities often take whoever they can get because they think nobody  will want to be a trustee,' she says. In fact, she argues, trustees will  come forward if the charity can communicate that they will be valued  and will make a difference.</p>
                <p>It is also important to be completely honest with candidates about  what their role will involve, says Smith. This includes saying how often  meetings will be held and when they will take place, how many hours the  trustee will be expected to spend on charity business each month and  whether they will be expected to sit on any sub-committees.</p>
                <p>'The big problem is that charities don't aim high enough or invest  enough time in the recruitment process,' says Janet Thorne, chief  executive of the charity Reach, which runs the TrusteeWorks trustee  brokerage service. 'It's about being clear what the role is,  communicating the value of the charity's work and explaining how  trustees can make a difference,' she says.</p>
                <p>There are a number of avenues charities can explore to widen their  pool of candidates, according to Twine. For example, very small  charities might want to consider placing adverts in local newsagents,  but larger ones might want to consider placing them in publications read  by accountants or lawyers.</p>
                <p>Twine says: 'Little things can go a long way. So it could simply be  using a neighbour's network of contacts rather than someone at the  charity, or talking to other charities in the area about people they  might recommend.'<br />
                  To get access to candidates with particular skills,  it is worth finding out which are the large employers in that field,  says Smith. 'Many big employers have internal newsletters and are often  open to charities including an appeal for potential trustees,' she says.  Using an external agency to help with recruitment is another  possibility.</p>
                <p>Thorne says good candidates are out there but charities might not  feel confident about finding them. Agencies such as TrusteeWorks, which  now offers its service free to small and medium-sized charities, can  help fill the gaps on boards, she says.<br />
                  Even when a candidate is  appointed, it is surprising how many charities fail to put an adequate  induction process in place, she says: 'A proper process is essential to  help the new trustee feel confident about the role and welcome in the  organisation.'</p>
                <p><strong>BOWEL CANCER CARE - AN OUTSIDE AGENCY 'WAS NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY COSTLY'</strong></p>
                <p>The charity Bowel Cancer Care used an external agency to help it recruit trustees with a broader range of skills.</p>
                <p>The charity's chief executive, Mark Flannagan, says it wanted to move  from being a small to a medium-sized charity and knew that it would  need to attract some new candidates.</p>
                <p>It asked Trustees Unlimited to help recruit two additional trustees  to its existing six-strong board, but ended up recruiting five more  because there were so many good candidates, according to Flannagan.</p>
                <p>He says that many charities draw up a list of skills they want to see  on their boards, but it is hard to actually find and recruit candidates  that have them.</p>
                <p>The process led to the appointment of trustees with specialist skills  in finance, consulting, health and pharmaceuticals. The previously  all-male board was also broadened to include female members.</p>
                <p>'One of the new trustees is a former charity chief executive and  another has become head of another charity since becoming a trustee with  us, which means I can get some insightful input on our own charity,'  says Flannagan.</p>
                <p>He says that using Trustees Unlimited was not disproportionately  expensive and it was funded from the charity's reserves: 'We decided  that we wanted to invest in this process in order to expand our  charity's work.'</p></td>

                Recent coverage of senior pay in the voluntary  sector has brought the issue of transparency to the fore. But what, if  anything, should charities be doing about it? Sophie Hudson reports.<br />
                <br />
                When The Daily Telegraph published research showing that 30  senior executives at 14 foreign aid charities - all members of the  Disasters Emergency Committee - were paid more than pounds 100,000 a  year, it opened a wider discussion on charity pay. <br />
                <br />
                The article and subsequent debate has put the issue of transparency among charities under the spotlight.<br />
                Justine  Greening, the international development secretary, wrote an article for  the Telegraph website in which she said that charities must be more  open about how they spend their money and should 'grasp the nettle on  transparency'.<br />
                <br />
                But what exactly constitutes transparency in the charity world? And are charities really doing such a bad job of it?<br />
                <br />
                Joe Saxton, co-founder of the consultancy nfpSynergy, says one of  the biggest problems is that transparency is not a clearly defined  concept 'When people are talking about transparency they are talking  about different things,' he says. 'Some people are talking about impact.  Other people are talking about finance and figures. It can be in the  way you present a set of figures. We probably do need some agreement  about what it means to be transparent.'<br />
                <br />
                Saxton hopes the debate will 'wake people up to the fact that  what charities are doing is out of kilter with what the public expects  of them. So charities need to either explain it all better or change  their practices.'<br />
                <br />
                He says the newspaper investigation and subsequent media attacks  on the sector showed that charities are poorly equipped to explain to  the public what they do. 'We actually want more of what the Telegraph is  doing so that we don't get the shock factor,' he says. 'We've been  lulled into a false sense of security.'<br />
                <br />
                One way for a charity to ensure it is being transparent would be  to have a page in the 'About Us' section of its website that sets out  key statistics, says Saxton. These could include details such as the  charity's total income, total number of beneficiaries, the proportion of  its income it spends on fundraising, the number of staff earning more  than pounds 60,000 and the chief executive's salary, he says. 'This is  nearly all data that will be in the annual report but is often very hard  to find on charities' websites,' says Saxton.<br />
                <br />
                The National Council for Voluntary Organisations also offers some  general tips for charities that are trying to improve their  transparency, urging them to use tools such as blogs and Twitter to  engage with supporters about their work, and not use them only for  marketing. It says charities should ensure their annual reports are  usable, making important information easy to find, and keep donors and  other stakeholders up to date throughout the year about the impact the  organisation is having.<br />
                <br />
                Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the NCVO, says there  is a mismatch between donor perception of charities and the realities of  the sector. 'We need to work hard to bring these together by having  greater transparency about what we do,' he says. 'We've got to be better  at explaining why we spend money in the way that we do.'<br />
                <br />
                But he warns that there could be short-term negative  repercussions from explaining how charities spend their money to donors  who had always imagined the organisations to be run entirely by  volunteers.<br />
                <br />
                'If it's not done well there is a risk that donors will say they  don't want to give any more because they don't agree with the way the  charity is run,' he says. 'But I would rather donors were more informed  in the long term.' To avoid this short-term problem, he says, charities  should ensure that they use communications effectively to explain the  impact they are having and the efficiency with which they are spending  money.<br />
                <br />
                Others, however, believe that charities are already transparent  enough. Sir Stephen Bubb, head of the charity chief executives body  Acevo, says the sector needs to be careful of falling into a  'transparency trap'.<br />
                <br />
                'I think charities are actually very open,' he says. 'We need to  be careful that we don't get drawn into an issue that isn't a problem.'<br />
                <br />
                But Bubb says it is important that charities improve the way they  explain to the public what they do. 'We are as transparent as we need  to be, but we are not so good at explaining the impact we have,' he  says.<br />
                <br />
                And, like Etherington, Bubb says there is a gap between  perceptions of how charities operate and the reality, partly because  charities have not explained to the public what they do very clearly.  Many people still think of the sector as largely voluntary, he says.<br />
                <br />
                Christian Aid decided to speak out in response to the furore over  executive pay and has experienced some concern from supporters since.  The charity put a statement on its website shortly after the Telegraph  research was published explaining exactly what its chief executive,  Loretta Minghella, was paid last year (pounds 126,206) and why. In a  note to its supporters the charity also invited them to ask it any  'tough questions', supplying them with an email address to do so.  Minghella says the charity has received a 'mixed response', but she  remains certain that transparency is vital for the sector. 'I think that  if you want people to have trust in your organisation, and charities  are funded on trust, then you have to be prepared to answer questions  about how you operate.'<br />
                <br />
                She says Christian Aid has always been transparent about the  salaries it pays executives in its annual reports, which are published  on its website, but wonders whether the charity should now consider  publishing this information elsewhere too, alongside details of its  impact and the complexity of its operations.<br />
                <br />
                Overall, Minghella says, the challenge for the whole sector is to  decide whether it is being transparent enough. 'I don't think it is  helpful to take a back seat at a time like this,' she says. 'I think  every organisation needs to think about whether it is doing enough to  communicate with its stakeholders.'<br />
                <br />
                Mike Whitlam, specialist adviser at Russam GMS, one of the  partners involved in the trustee recruitment organisation Trustees  Unlimited, says that trustees should be speaking out about how they  manage their funds. Whitlam, who helped to set up Acevo more than 25  years ago, suggests the formation of an umbrella body to represent  charity trustees. 'There isn't actually an organisation that represents  trustees,' he says. 'Maybe there's a need for one, either on its own or  within an organisation like Acevo, so that they can make their views  known - particularly since it's trustees that sign off the accounts.'<br />
                <br />
                Overall, he says, the sector should be doing everything possible  to be transparent. 'I've been working in the sector for 40-odd years and  my position on this has not changed in that time,' Whitlam says. 'We  have a duty to let our donors and beneficiaries have as much information  as possible so they can see we are using funds in a way they would  expect.'<br />
                <br />
                <strong>WHAT THE REGULATOR SAYS<br />
                  </strong><br />
                'Some charities let the sector down' - Sam Younger, chief  executive of the Charity Commission, says there is 'definite room for  improvement' on transparency.<br />
                <br />
                'Sadly, some charities let the sector down by failing to meet  even the minimum reporting standards,' he says, referring in particular  to submitting annual returns and accounts, which are publicly available  on the online Register of Charities.<br />
                <br />
                But Younger says the commission wants charities to go beyond this  legal minimum when explaining their expenditure and achievements. 'It's  also about a commitment to demonstrating accountability and helping the  public understand what a charity achieves with its resources,' he says.<br />
                <br />
                Sometimes, he says, this can mean tackling difficult issues head  on. 'For example, explaining why the appointment of a new chief  executive at a competitive salary, or a project requiring extensive  travel, is in the best interests of the charity and its beneficiaries,  before being challenged on it,' he says.<br />
                <br />
                Younger says that if trustees cannot explain their decisions to  the public they should not be surprised if they receive criticism.<br />
                <br />
                'Charities that take transparency seriously and get their  messages across effectively stand to benefit from increased support, and  those failing to do so risk undermining public trust in the sector as a  whole,' he says.</p></td>

                Ian Joseph, Director of Trustees Unlimited and Director, Charities and Not-for-Profit practice, Russam GMS said, “We set up Trustees Unlimited because we recognised that many organisations were finding it difficult to recruit outside their immediate networks and find new candidates. Two years on, we have helped many organisations find trustees who can bring specific skills or experience who are now making a real impact. <br />
                <br />
                “In the current economic climate, charities and social enterprises need to have the best people on their boards to ensure they can face the challenges ahead and we can source such people at affordable prices. We are recruiting for a growing number of charities and social enterprises and have also just been appointed as a preferred supplier to the National Union of Students – and we are looking forward to recruiting young trustees for UK charities.”</p></td>

Almost 100 aspiring trustees gathered at <strong>NCVO'</strong>s offices in London to learn what being a trustee in a charity today is all about. Speakers from <strong>NCVO</strong> and Trustees Unlimited discussed the key responsibilities of trustees, as well as the rewards and liabilities and then gave the attendees plenty of advice and tips on how to secure a trustee role.

                <p>It was a full house at Trustees Unlimited's first pre-board training event held on 28 March at NCVO's offices in London with over 100 aspiring trustees in attendance.  The delegates came to find out what being a trustee is all about and the responsibilities, rewards and risks involved, and the challenges facing the Not for Profit sector. <br />
                  <br />
                  To open the event, Stephen Brooker, one of Trustee Unlimited's directors and Chairman of the Charities and Not for Profit Practice at Russam GMS and Richard Williams, Director of Enterprise and Development at NCVO welcomed everyone and shared some of their own experiences working as trustees. They stressed how delighted they were that the event was well attended and there was such an interest in trusteeship, in spite of the current economic gloom. They emphasised that good boards are diverse ones, and that boards with trustees of different ages and backgrounds, with a mix of skills and experiences tend to be more robust and make better decisions. <br />
                  <br />
                  Karl Wilding, NCVO's Head of Research, presented the audience with an overview of the UK's Civil Society Sector.  It became evident quickly that with over 170,000 UK charitable organisations, from large big brand charities to small organisations employing just a few people, there are many and varied trustee opportunities.  Karl stated that contrary to popular belief, the UK is a nation of volunteers, with one in four people volunteering their time and that a surprising 950,000 people are already trustees. <br />
                  <br />
                  He also said that any new trustee needs to be aware that funding is the biggest challenge for the sector this year.  Whilst income always has been skewed to the larger charities, the government cuts will mean that many smaller organisations who are reliant on government funding will now struggle to survive.  Additionally, the government's changes to the commissioning of services under its Big Society agenda will leave some organisations struggling to adapt. The audience was advised to ask prudent questions about an organisation's governance, financial management and future growth plans before they take on any new trusteeship. <br />
                  <br />
                  Anne Moynihan, Head of NCVO's Governance and Leadership team, discussed the roles and responsibilities of a trustee. She said that because the board of trustees is ultimately responsible for everything a charity does there are many considerations to think about and pitfalls to avoid before taking on a board position. Anne commented that whilst she wasn't trying to deter would-be trustees, they needed to understand the risks and liabilities involved in trusteeship. <br />

              <td><p>How can charities get more young people on their boards? <br />
                <br />
                Research carried out last year by <a href="http://www.trustees-unlimited.co.uk/">Trustees Unlimited</a> found that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2012/nov/06/charities-educate-trustees-diversity">20% of trustees said their charity board lacked a diverse range of skills</a>, and over half believed that a more diverse board would enhance their charity's effectiveness.<br />
                <br />
                Charity boards have long been criticised for lacking young <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/trustees" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Trustees">trustees</a>. According to research released by the <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/index.aspx">Charity Commission</a> in 2010, only 0.5% of charity trustees were aged 18-24. The report, called a <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/RSS/News/pr_rs23.aspx">Breath of Fresh Air</a>, also found the mean age of a charity trustee was 57.<br />
                Neal Green, senior policy adviser at the Charity Commission, says it has not gathered statistics on the number of young people on boards since 2010, but that involvement in <a href="http://trusteesweek.blogspot.co.uk/">Trustees' Week</a> has been very encouraging. &quot;There's a sense of a bit of a buzz,&quot; he says. &quot;Some <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/charities" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Charities">charities</a> are starting to have more diverse boards, but not many.&quot;<br />
                But is it really that important for charities to include young people on their boards? And, if so, how can charities encourage this?<br />
                &quot;Good board diversity is part of being governed effectively,&quot; says Green. &quot;Having young people on the board helps you better understand those people in society. It's one important aspect of diversity of skills and experience.&quot; He explains that part of good decision-making is about being properly informed; if the board has a mix of backgrounds and points of view, then a more rounded decision can be made.<br />
                <br />
                Lindsay Driscoll, a governance consultant, agrees. &quot;Young people come with different approaches and suggestions, and they will challenge assumptions,&quot; she says. &quot;The decisions are only as good as the input from the range of people.&quot;<br />
                <br />
                But she says finding and appointing young people is not easy. &quot;You have to make the effort to work out where people are going to find you – it could be advertising through social media,&quot; she says. &quot;You may have to look at recruitment practices and how you operate, but you're going to have to make an effort, and not all boards are prepared to do that.&quot;<br />
                <br />
                Green suggests using organisations such as the <a href="http://www.nus.org.uk/">National Union of Students</a> or local Scout groups as sources of enthusiastic young people. And he says that once they are appointed, keeping new, young trustees engaged is crucial. &quot;You need to think about giving them support with all the technical stuff, and providing them with mentoring,&quot; he says. &quot;And remember to value what they say. It can be a culture shock to have new trustees on the board.&quot;<br />
                <br />
                Alex Swallow, founder of <a href="http://youngcharitytrustees.org/">Young Charity Trustees</a>, agrees that it is important young trustees are not just appointed as a &quot;token gesture&quot;. &quot;Doing an induction and making sure someone on the board can serve as their mentor is important,&quot; he says, adding that young people may need training and support with things such as charity finance, but that this training could be beneficial to other trustees at the same time. &quot;It's quite a clever way of introducing new training for the board, as it doesn't make others feel self-conscious about a lack of skills,&quot; he says.<br />
                <br />
                When Amy Foan joined the <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/">British Red Cross</a>'s board in 2010 as a young trustee, having been elected when she was 25, she says she felt daunted, but the effort made to welcome her helped.<br />
                <br />
                &quot;I lacked confidence when I first started, as all the other trustees had a lot more experience,&quot; she says. &quot;But the Red Cross is very welcoming and everyone was very excited about me joining.&quot; She says she had a lot of training during her induction and the chair would always ask what she thought during meetings.<br />
                Caroline Leighton, chief de cabinet for the British Red Cross, says having young trustees on its board means it can better engage with young volunteers, who will shape the organisation in the future. &quot;Young trustees provide a fresh perspective; they have a different outlook and experience, especially in areas such as new technology,&quot; she says. &quot;Around 20% of our volunteers are under 25, so it's essential for us to provide younger people with a voice on our board.&quot;<br />
                <br />
                Damien Clarkson, who became a trustee of the <a href="http://youngachieversawards.org/">Young Achievers Trust</a> in 2010, aged 25, says charities need to promote the benefits of being a trustee to young people.<br />
                &quot;They could promote things like all the connections you can make and the experience you can get,&quot; he says. &quot;It can help to build networks and can be good for your career. It's a good thing to understand and is a big responsibility. I now run my own business and being on a board really helped me with that.&quot;<br />
                <br />
                And he says that as long as existing trustees are properly briefed on the role of a young trustee that joins the board, charities will not regret taking them on. &quot;It needs to be a slightly different role and others need to understand why they are there,&quot; he says. &quot;Whatever you learn from it, you won't regret it. As you get older you get set in your thought patterns – young people may throw up something very interesting. You may learn something that could really help the organisation.&quot; <br />

              <td><p>The start of a new year is often the time when people think about giving something back to society and many make the decision to start volunteering for a charity. Taking on a trustee role at a charity is something many would consider, however, it can be difficult for people to find out about suitable positions. Many find it a closed network difficult to penetrate.<br />
                <br />
                It is widely acknowledged that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/charities" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Charities">charities</a> have difficulties recruiting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/trustees" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Trustees">trustees</a> with the right skills and experience. According to the<a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/"> Charity Commission</a>, around one in five charities in the UK has a trustee vacancy. When you consider there are around 180,000 charitable organisations registered in the UK, it seems there are many opportunities for people if only charities were better at marketing their positions.<br />
                We recently surveyed 1,600 trustees to find why people become trustees and the top reason was to 'give something back' (55%), second to gain new skills and improve professional development (33%), and third because they were committed to a charity's cause (30%).<br />
                However, we also found the main barrier preventing people becoming trustees is the lack of knowledge about trustee vacancies and what trusteeship involves. The respondents also said that charities are not good at promoting opportunities. While there are clearly trustee vacancies out there, 38% of our respondents are still looking for a trustee position.<br />
                <br />
                So how do people find out about trustee roles? Our research found that 45% of those currently in a trustee role responded to a job advert, but 45% were recruited via an acquaintance or colleague. The majority also said that charities need to do more to educate people about what trusteeship involves and to promote their vacancies.<br />
                It seems the way in which many organisations are currently recruiting trustees is hindering the diversity of their boards. Our research found that one in five trustees said their charity board lacks a diverse range of skills and over half (51%) said a more diverse board would enhance their charity's effectiveness. One of the biggest problems is that charities often do not search outside their own networks to attract the best talent. We know that diverse boards make better decisions and yet too many are replete with the same type of people – often white, middle class men of a certain age.<br />
                <br />
                In 2013, the economic outlook is unclear, with limited predictions of growth. We know that charities will need to function more commercially than ever before in order to survive. Recruiting trustees with professional skills from more diverse backgrounds could help an organisation perform more effectively in such a climate.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>So how do charities recruit the best trustee talent?</strong><br />
                One key piece of advice is that organisations with trustee vacancies should test the market. Even in cases where there are strong existing board members who perhaps wish to take the chair role, it is good practice to put them through a competitive process and compare them with potential candidates from outside. By doing this and widening the search when recruiting trustees, charities will have a board that has a diverse range of skills and knowledge, as well as a better mix of people of different ages and backgrounds. A third of trustees said that diversity could be improved by recruiting more people from ethnic backgrounds or younger people (31%) and having a more diverse board should definitely be on the agenda for every charity in 2013.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Below are my top tips for charities who want to recruit the best trustee talent in 2013:</strong><br />
                • Create a role description, outlining not just what you want the person to do, but the expected time commitments, location and times of meetings.<br />
                • Conduct an audit of the competencies, knowledge and experience needed for the role and recruit to that brief.<br />
                • Engage the whole board in the process.<br />
                • Think about why someone would be interested in coming to volunteer for you. You may be passionate about the cause, but does your marketing material make a compelling proposition?<br />
                • Write a punchy advertisement.<br />
                • Prepare an information pack for candidates that includes a link to the memorandum and articles of association, the accounts, biographies of your trustees, governance structure, including sub committees and anything else that could be useful.<br />
                • Use social media to promote the trustee role.<br />
                • Consider using a professional recruitment firm with a track record of recruiting trustees.<br />
                • Be clear about who is making the decision. Is it the existing trustees or the membership? This needs to be clear upfront to avoid surprises later.<br />
                • Have a clear process for informal meetings, tours of services and interviews.<br />
                • Interviews should be evidence based to test motivation as well as skills and experience.<br />
                • Always take verbal references.<br />
                • Have a good induction process in place.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
                • Relying on word of mouth.<br />
                • Not disclosing the true state of affairs, eg – the reserves have run out!<br />

                <p>Volunteering is on the rise. Encouraged by the success of the  volunteer programme at the London 2012 Olympics, which saw 70,000 games  makers fulfil 800 roles, more professional people are looking at ways in  which they can give something back. </p>
                <p>Official Statistics<a target="_blank" href="http://communitylife.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/assets/q4-2012-13/Community%20Life%20Survey%20Q4%202012-13%20Bulletin.pdf">[i]</a> released by the Cabinet Office in April 2013 revealed that 72% of  people had volunteered at least once in the last 12 months, with 44% of  people volunteering formally and 62% volunteering informally,  significant increases from 2010/11 (65%, 35% and 55% respectively). Many  charities have also reported a doubling in monthly inquiries from would  be volunteers since last summer.</p>
                <p>Trustees Unlimited, a joint venture recruitment company set up by  NCVO, Russam GMS and Bates Wells Braithwaite has noted that many of the  trustees they recruit to charity boards are full time professionals in  their 30s and 40s, looking to gain new skills and experience outside of  their day to day careers.</p>
                <p>Last year, the company conducted research amongst 1200 trustees and  found that the number one reason people become a trustee is to &lsquo;give  something back&rsquo; (55%), secondly to gain new skills and improve  professional development (33%) and thirdly because they are committed to  a charity&rsquo;s cause (30%).  </p>
                <p>The fact that trusteeship leads to new skills and enhances employability is supported by a report from Third Sector Research<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tsrc.ac.uk/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=tGaSOT2tnRU%3d&amp;tabid=1016">[ii]</a> last month, &lsquo;Does Volunteering Improve Employability&rsquo; which found that  volunteering enhances career prospects for 45-60 year olds, however, the  report also highlighted that this was not the case for young people.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, Chief Executive of Trustees Unlimited comments, &ldquo;Becoming  a trustee can enhance the appeal of CVs for people looking for more  senior roles in their 30s and early 40s. We have noticed a big rise in  demand for trustee positions amongst mid life professionals working full  time who might want a change of direction, add a new dimension to their  careers or simply do something more philanthropic.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Serving on a board of trustees is also a big opportunity to learn  new skills, including governance, finance and the opportunity to work  with different people from all walks of life. It is a big responsibility  and it can be life changing. &ldquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Taking on a trusteeship can enhance employability for people at all  stages of their careers and arguably graduates job hunting in a  competitive market potentially stand to benefit most. If there were two  applicants with similar qualifications at interview, the one with  volunteering experience would have the edge.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>One charity that has recently recruited three mid career professional  trustees is Music of Life, a small charity providing high quality  musical education and performance opportunities for children and young  people with disabilities and special needs. The charity was looking for  new trustees, following recent departures, with expertise in marketing  and communications, finance and fundraising and ideally experience of  working in the fields of disability or education.</p>
                <p>The three trustees chosen are all working professionals – Stephanie  Stewart a former charity CEO, Jessica Clark, a lawyer, school governor  and already a trustee at Brent Community Law Centre, whose son also has  special needs; and Elly Williamson, a financial PR consultant who is  also a musician and has great contacts in the arts world.</p>
                <p>Since being in the roles the chief executive of Music of Life, Maria  Teterina has commented that the organisation has already been  transformed because of their specialist skills and passion for the cause  and the charity is planning ahead with confidence and developing a new  strategic plan which she believes they will be able deliver.</p></td>

                <p>5 November 2012 – One in five trustees say their charity board lacks a diverse range of skills and over half (51%) believe that a more diverse board would enhance their charity’s effectiveness, according to new research from Trustees Unlimited. A third of trustees said that diversity could be improved by recruiting more people from ethnic backgrounds or younger people (31%).</p>
                <p>Trustees Unlimited questioned its database* to assess if there are any the barriers preventing people becoming trustees today and the challenges trustees face.</p>
                <p>The number one barrier preventing people becoming trustees is the lack of knowledge about where the opportunities are (33%), a lack of knowledge about what trusteeship involves (25%) and the fact charities are not good at promoting their opportunities (21%).</p>
                <p>According to Charity Commission reports**, 39% of UK charities have difficulties recruiting trustees. Interestingly, 38% of the survey respondents are still looking for a trustee position. Out of those with a trustee role, 45% responded to a job advert and 45% were recruited via an acquaintance or colleague. Just 9% were recruited through a recruitment company and only 1% through a scheme at work.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, CEO of Trustees Unlimited says: “One in five trustees say their board lacks diversity which is unsurprising given that half of trustees are recruited by friends and acquaintances. Diverse boards make better decisions but because many charities are recruiting within their own networks, they are missing out on talent. There are highly skilled professionals from all backgrounds and disciplines failing to find suitable roles in spite of the fact many charities need the skills these people possess. This is a clear disconnect in the sector that we are trying to bridge.”</p>
                <p>However, being a trustee is not without its challenges. According to the report,  the main issues for trustees are ‘the time commitments’, the difficulty of ‘understanding of financial management issues’, ‘understanding and getting on with fellow trustees’ and ‘understanding governance, the role and responsibilities’.</p>
                <p>Trustees claimed that better education is needed about trusteeship and that charities need to do more to promote their trustee positions to encourage more people to volunteer as trustees.</p>
                <p>Charity governance also emerged as a big issue, with one in ten respondents saying they hadn’t been given the charities governing documents to read when they started. 43% said they hadn’t received an induction and 46% hadn’t seen any job description outlining their remit and responsibilities. Over half (52%) wanted more training with 64% required training in governance, 59% in managing risks and liabilities and 40% said that training in finance would help them.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph says: “Trusteeships can be highly rewarding and even life changing, but people need to be aware of the risks and liabilities involved. Charities have an obligation to ensure trustees are fully aware of their responsibilities and proper inductions are essential and in some cases, this clearly isn’t happening.”</p>
                <p>“With Trustee Week upon us, there is a clear message emerging which is that charities need to do more to promote themselves to a wider audience. Charities have to function more commercially than ever before in order to survive. Recruiting trustees with professional skills from more diverse backgrounds could lead to better decision making, greater innovation and ensure organisations operate more effectively and competitively.”</p>
                <p>“Equally, there is an opportunity for businesses wanting to improve their corporate social responsibility - they could encourage employees to take on a trustee role. Only 1% of trustees in our research applied through a scheme at work, so clearly there is a huge opportunity here.”</p>

                <p>Some 68% of charity sector workers are women, so it's disappointing that only 25% of the top 100 charities have female chief executives. </p>
                <p> When it comes to women holding senior leadership and board positions, the charity sector is ahead of the private sector. However, according to a recent report <a href="http://women-count.org/Women-Count-Report-2012.pdf" target="_blank">Women Count: Charity Leaders 2012</a>, charities still need to work harder to improve gender diversity at board level.</p>
                <p> <a href="http://women-count.org/" target="_blank">Women Count</a> found that only 25% of the top 100 charities by income have female chief executives and only 17% of the top 100 charities by assets have female chief executives. This lack of gender diversity also applies to the trustees – four charities out of the top 100 by income have no female trustees and just 17% of chairs are women. Among the top 100 charities by assets, 12 have no female trustees and another 12 have only one female trustee.</p>
                <p> Compare this to FTSE 250 companies, where only 2.4% of chairs, 9.4% of board members and 4% of chief executives are women, and charities seem to be leading the way in gender diversity. However, when you consider that 68% of workers in the charity sector are women, the figures are disappointing. </p>
                <p>The sector has many boards that are stale, pale and male. We all know that diverse boards make better decisions and high-performing boards tend to have trustees with a range of skills and experience, who can improve governance and enhance decision-making. The business case is quite clear.</p>
                <p> Achieving a more balanced board is even more important in today's economic climate as funders and commissioners are increasingly examining boards as part of their due diligence and those that are not diverse will suffer where it hurts most – in their pockets.</p>
                <p> Charities need to do more to progress female talent and equip them for the board by providing leadership training, mentoring and coaching, and creating talent pipelines to progress women with leadership potential from more junior roles. They also need to audit their boardroom skills and look at ways they could improve and review their recruitment processes for employees and trustees to widen the gene pool.</p>
                <p> A recent study of trustee appointments from the <a href="http://www.instituteforphilanthropy.org/" target="_blank">Institute of Philanthropy,The State of UK Charity Boards</a>, found that around half of trustees are appointed through personal recommendations and just 20% of charities advertised to fill their trustee vacancies. This needs to change, particularly in light of the fact that almost one in five charities has a board vacancy.</p>
                <p> Recruiting from such a narrow pool can create problems — a lack of diversity on boards, a limited outlook and in many cases skills and talent shortages that could hinder performance. To change the status quo, it is essential that charities recruit candidates and trustees from outside their own networks.</p>
                <p> <a href="http://www.trustees-unlimited.co.uk/" target="_blank">Trustees Unlimited</a> helps charities recruit trustees from different backgrounds, and its sister organisation <a href="http://www.nonexecutives-unlimited.co.uk/" target="_blank">Non-Executives Unlimited</a> focuses on non-executive director (NED) recruitment. More than 1,500 potential candidates have registered and are looking for board-level vacancies. These candidates offer a mix of skills and have backgrounds in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. Charities can tap into this talent and find people with the right skills for their boards.</p>
                <p> There are also free resources available, such as social networking sites, that can be used to attract talent. Charities could be making more use of social-media channels such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter to engage with new candidates and trustees. </p>
                <p> The sector has become much more professional over the past 20 years, but its performance on governance still has some way to go. It seems that if things are going to change, the sector needs to change the way it recruits talent and put in place formal development programmes for women that will enable them to access boards more easily.</p>

                <p>With one in five graduates unable to find work   and youth unemployment figures at a seventeen year high, getting a foot on   the career ladder has never been harder.</p>
                <p>This Student Volunteering Week (20th-26th Feb),   Trustees Unlimited,&nbsp; a joint venture trustee recruitment company set up   by NCVO, Bates Wells Braithwaite and Russam GMS is urging graduates to   sign up to become a charity trustee and gain new skills and work experience   that will help them win jobs in the future.</p>
                <p>Trustees Unlimited was recently appointed as a   preferred supplier of trustees to over 600 students unions and together with   Student Hubs (<a href="http://www.studenthubs.org/" title="blocked::http://www.studenthubs.org/">http://www.studenthubs.org/</a>) has been   encouraging students to register with the service. Several students have   registered their interest however the organisation wants to encourage greater   numbers to sign up to help meet current demand.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph, a Director at Trustees Unlimited   commented, &ldquo;Many UK charities are crying out for young, enthusiastic trustees   to join their boards. They are actively seeking young graduates to fill   vacant trustee positions to breathe fresh air, renewed enthusiasm and a new   perspective into their Charity. There are around 200,000 charitable   organisations in the UK and around one in five is likely to have a trustee   vacancy – so there are many and varied opportunities out there.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&rdquo;With graduate unemployment at a high becoming a   trustee could offer students and graduates a chance to develop new skills and   become more employable, and at the same time contribute to society. We hope   that many students will register their availability with us so charities can   benefit from their talent and ideas.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Volunteering is already popular amongst students   – according to research from Volunteering England.&nbsp; 63% of students have   volunteered for a charity since they had started university and donated a   total of just over 3 million hours to communities in the 2009/10 academic   year*.</p>
                <p>Becoming a Charity trustee helps young people   learn about how charities and other organisations are run and gives them   experience in areas such as setting strategic goals, accounting, financial   planning and employment practice.</p>
                <p>Ian Joseph adds, &ldquo;We hope that Student   Volunteering Week 2012 will be the year that many students make the decision   to become a trustee. However, we urge them to be aware of the risks and   liabilities involved in trusteeship first and to undertake due diligence and   research into an organisation before they apply for and accept a role.&rdquo;   &nbsp;<br />
                  Here are a few of Ian&rsquo;s top tips for students   looking for a trustee position:</p>
                <p>Be sure that this is really something you want to   do. Do lots of research online about the pros and cons of being a trustee   before making a decision<br />
                  Visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/" title="blocked::http://www.volunteering.org.uk/">http://www.volunteering.org.uk</a>website as   there&rsquo;s lots of useful information on how to volunteer and how you can   accredit your volunteering with UCAS points<br />
                  There are lots of events taking place during   Student Volunteering Week, take full advantage and go along to as many as you   can.

                  <br />
                  Register your interest direct with Trustees   Unlimited, the preferred supplier for NUS. It&rsquo;s easy to do, just visit the   website:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trusteesunlimited.co.uk/wanttobeatrusteeform.html" title="blocked::http://www.trusteesunlimited.co.uk/wanttobeatrusteeform.html">http://www.trusteesunlimited.co.uk/wanttobeatrusteeform.html</a><br />
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;Make sure you do your homework and find a   charity you feel really passionate about. If you are going to dedicate a lot   of time to the charity, you need to feel strongly about it<br />
                  Be aware of the time commitments. Every charity   will have different expectations. Make sure you can give it the time it   requires but that there is still time available for you to look for full time   employment and attend interviews. Don&rsquo;t over commit!<br />
                  <br />
                  The interview stage is crucial - it has to be a   two way conversation. This is the opportunity for you to get the information   and answers you need to make the right decision.<br />
                  What training and induction is provided for   trustees – make sure you ask this question at the outset.<br />
                  <br />
                  Every charity has a governance document   containing rules for trustees. Make sure you see this at the outset, as it is   your duty to comply with these rules and you may be held responsible if you   don&rsquo;t.<br />
                  <br />
                  Lastly, remember you will need to put the organisation   first if there is a crisis or urgent need. As a trustee it is your duty to   put the charity before other commitments.</p></td>

                <p>Trustees Unlimited's&nbsp;<strong>Ian Joseph</strong>&nbsp;advises young people about what they should consider before becoming a charity trustee. <br />
                  <br />
                  A report published this month by the Commission on Youth Unemployment found that&nbsp;<a href="http://dev.acevo.org.uk/commission-on-youth-unemployment-calls-for-emergency-action-as-research-finds-28bn-timebomb-on-uk-finances/" title="">youth unemployment has reached an emergency point</a>.<br />
                  <br />
                  With one in five young people not in employment, education or training and 250,000 unemployed for more than a year, the commission described it as one of the greatest challenges facing the country. It also said that the government faced a £28bn timebomb. Competition in the job market has never been tougher for young people and getting a foot on the career ladder has never been more challenging.<br />
                  <br />
                  This week is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/student-volunteering-week-2012" title="">Student Volunteering Week</a>&nbsp;– a time to celebrate the contribution young people make to good causes. It is also a time to encourage more students to volunteer and, in the current job market, there isn't a better time for young people to volunteer. Through volunteering, they will become more employable, learn vital new skills, gain work experience and make valuable contacts that could open the door to future job opportunities. </p>
                <p>A recent report published by Volunteering England highlighted that volunteering is already popular among students.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=63%25%20of%20students%20have%20volunteered%20for%20a%20charity%20since%20they%20had%20started%20university&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDoQFjAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicengagement.ac.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FNCCPE%2520-%2520Bursting%2520the%2520bubble.pdf&amp;ei=aeRET9OPM-ag0QX77qnoAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEztjAJ9PkP90G_auEptTL1VexReA&amp;cad=rja" title="">63% of students have volunteered for a charity since they started university</a>&nbsp;and between them donated a total of just over 3m hours to communities in the 2009/10 academic year.</p>
                <p>However, one of the areas often overlooked by volunteers are the opportunities that exist within charities to join trustee boards. Just&nbsp;<a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Library/guidance/rs23text.pdf" title="">2.1% of UK trustees are under 30 years of age</a>, so young people are hugely under-represented on charity boards – something which many in the sector want to change.</p>
                <p>Some of the barriers to trusteeship for young people seem to be the fact they don't know enough about the trustee opportunities that exist and what it entails, or they don't feel they have accrued enough work experience or skills. On the contrary – many charities are crying out for young, motivated people who can demonstrate a willingness to learn and are passionate about a charity's ethos and goals. There are about 200,000 charitable organisations in the UK and one in five is likely to have a trustee vacancy – so there are many varied opportunities available.<br />
                  <br />
                  Becoming a charity trustee offers many benefits. Young people will learn how organisations are run and gain experience in areas such as setting strategic goals, accounting, financial planning and employment practice. Such experience would enhance any CV and give young trustees an edge over other jobseekers in an interview situation.<br />
                  <br />

                  <br />
                  We hope that Student Volunteering Week 2012 will prompt more students to consider becoming a trustee. It is not a decision to be taken lightly as it is a major commitment and comes with liabilities and responsibilities. We would advise any would-be trustee to do their homework first.<br />
                  <br />
                  Here are my top considerations for anyone thinking of becoming a trustee:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Be sure that this is really something you want to do. Do lots of research online about the pros and cons of being a trustee before making a decision.</li>

There are around 200,000 charitable organisations in the UK and around one in five is likely to have a trustee vacancy – so there are many and varied opportunities out there.”<br />
                <br />
                ”With graduate unemployment at a high becoming a trustee could offer students and graduates a chance to develop new skills and become more employable, and at the same time contribute to society. We hope that many students will register their availability with us so charities can benefit from their talent and ideas.”<br />
                <br />
                Volunteering is already popular amongst students – according to research from Volunteering England.  63% of students have volunteered for a charity since they had started university and donated a total of just over 3 million hours to communities in the 2009/10 academic year*.<br />
                <br />
                Becoming a Charity trustee helps young people learn about how charities and other organisations are run and gives them experience in areas such as setting strategic goals, accounting, financial planning and employment practice.<br />
              </p>
                <p>Ian Joseph adds, “We hope that Student Volunteering Week 2012 will be the year that many students make the decision to become a trustee. However, we urge them to be aware of the risks and liabilities involved in trusteeship first and to undertake due diligence and research into an organisation before they apply for and accept a role.” </p>

                      <br />
                      Make sure you do your homework and find a charity you feel really passionate about. If you are going to dedicate a lot of time to the charity, you need to feel strongly about it<br />
                      <br />
                      Be aware of the time commitments. Every charity will have different expectations. Make sure you can give it the time it requires but that there is still time available for you to look for full time employment and attend interviews. Don’t over commit!<br />
                      <br />
                      The interview stage is crucial - it has to be a two way conversation. This is the opportunity for you to get the information and answers you need to make the right decision.<br />
                      <br />
                      What training and induction is provided for trustees – make sure you ask this question<br />
                      <br />
                      Every charity has a governance document containing rules for trustees. Make sure you see this at the outset, as it is your duty to comply with these rules and you may be held responsible if you don’t.<br />
                      <br />
                      Lastly, remember you will need to put the organisation first if there is a crisis or urgent need. As a trustee it is your duty to put the charity before other commitments</td>

              <td><p><a href="http://www.hrzone.co.uk/topic/strategies/news-chancellors-autumn-budget-statement-hr-glance/125536">In his Autumn Statement this week</a>, Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK economy is set to shrink by a worse than expected 0.1% this year.<br />
                So with an uncertain business climate ahead, businesses will need to work more smartly than ever to ensure that their employees are productive and engaged during 2013.<br />
                One option for employers looking to develop employee performance, however, is to encourage them to volunteer as trustees.<br />
                As well as contributing to corporate social responsibility activity, trusteeships can help boost staff morale and productivity by giving people the opportunity to gain valuable experience and skills in areas ranging from setting strategic goals to accounting and financial planning.<br />
                We recently conducted a survey of more than 1,200 trustees in order to understand why people go down this route as well as the barriers and challenges that they face.<br />
                The research revealed that the top three reasons were &lsquo;to give something back&rsquo; (55%); to improve professional development (33%) and because they were committed to a given charity&rsquo;s cause (30%).<br />
                But respondents also pointed out that they often didn&rsquo;t know how to go about becoming a trustee or where opportunities existed. As a result, they suggested that charities needed to do more to promote their vacancies.<br />
                According to the <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/">Charity Commission</a>, an estimated one in five of the UK&rsquo;s 180,000 charities has a vacancy on their board, which highlights the fact that they are struggling to reach new trustees.<br />
                The lack of boardroom diversity is another problem. Young people, women and people from ethnic backgrounds are all underrepresented – a fact that many organisations would like to change, not least to gain access to a wider variety of skills.</p>
                <p><strong>Serious commitment</strong> <br />
                  However, it is important to note that being a trustee is hard work and requires a serious commitment. They are ultimately responsible for everything that a charity does and can be held legally accountable for the decisions made.</p>
                <p>Consequently, we urge people to understand the liabilities involved and to undertake due diligence and research into target organisations before they accept a role.</p>
                <p>The interview stage is particularly important as it provides an opportunity for candidates to obtain the necessary information in order to ensure that they are making the right decision. Here are some possible questions to ask at interview stage and before you accept a post:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Be clear about the rules and responsibilities that you are taking on – who are the decision-makers and who aren&rsquo;t? </li>
                  <li>What is the organisation&rsquo;s leadership style? </li>
                  <li>What are its strategic direction and business objectives? </li>
                  <li>What resources does it have at its disposal, ranging from any land that it owns to intellectual property and trademarks? </li>
                  <li>What training and induction processes are offered to new trustees? </li>
                  <li>What time commitment will be expected (each charity is different)? </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Also bear in mind that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Every charity will have a governance document containing rules by which trustees must abide. Ensure that you see this from the outset as it is your duty to comply and you be held responsible if you do not </li>
                  <li>Remember that, as a trustee, it is your duty to put the charity before other commitments so you will need to put it first if there is a crisis or urgent need </li>
                  <li>Understand who the beneficiaries of the charity are as it will be here that the organisation&rsquo;s loyalty lies </li>
                  <li>Be careful about what &lsquo;collective&rsquo; board decisions are made. If you do not agree with a decision, you must register your dissent. Read the minutes if you are not able to make a meeting as it is your duty and responsibility to ensure that you have your say. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although all of these factors need to be considered carefully, there are huge benefits and rewards in becoming a trustee. UK charities are crying out for talent and many are keen to attract people from diverse backgrounds, young and old, in order to inject energy and fresh ideas into their boardrooms.<br />
                  But how does this situation benefit employers? For starters, the experience and skills that your employees can obtain by going down this path could also help to inject energy and fresh ideas into your business.<br />
                  As we enter 2013, employers will be looking for cost-effective ways to invest in staff development - and this could just prove an ideal route to take.<br />

              <td><p>Many organisations struggle to recruit trustees but Richard Williams, non-executive director of Trustees Unlimited, has this advice</p>
                <p>A <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/About_us/About_charities/More_than.aspx">Charity Commission survey</a> this month revealed two-fifths of organisations had difficulty recruiting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/trustees" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Trustees">trustees</a>. This matches our experience at <a href="http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/">NCVO</a>, where members often tell us that finding the right trustees is a challenge. It is an area our advisers are frequently asked to help with.<br />
                  It's worth giving careful thought to how you go about recruiting new trustees: who you are looking for, how you will reach them, how you will attract them, and how you will hang on to them.<br />
                  <br />
                  Many organisations look to their supporters and networks as well as friends and colleagues of existing trustees when seeking new board members. Of course, it's likely that people who will take an interest in your organisation are already known to it, but it is far from inevitable, and there is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2012/nov/06/charities-educate-trustees-diversity">danger in recruiting solely from your existing supporters </a>or the networks of board members.<br />
                  <br />
                  Boards need to be champions for their organisations, but they also need to question them. It's widely acknowledged that more diverse boards tend to make better decisions. Few in the voluntary sector can say they have never seen an organisation suffer because trustees with long-standing involvement have been reluctant to make necessary changes. Even if you don't see the need for change immediately, input from those new to the organisation and with few personal ties to others can bring useful new perspectives. Your networks should be part of your recruitment strategy, but not all of it.<br />
                  <br />
                  To focus your recruitment and ensure you find people best-placed to help your organisation, consider what skills you would like new trustees to bring. This could be anything from operational or frontline experience to fundraising, accounting, policy or legal knowledge. Comparing the organisation's priorities with an assessment of existing trustees' skills should make gaps apparent.<br />
                  <br />
                  Before you start recruiting, you need to ensure that you are acting in line with your governing documents, or change them if necessary. But you also need to ask whether the board and the organisation are prepared. Are you ready to welcome new people and their ideas? Could you change when, where or how you meet in order to help others become involved? Are there any disputes or tensions that are best resolved before you open yourselves to new people?<br />
                  Think about how to sell the role. Ask what motivated the current board members to join and to stay. Try to create a job advert that reflects this. Think about where the people you would like to attract would be likely to see your advert – whether it's a local venue, specialist press, a volunteering website or elsewhere. <a href="http://www.trustees-unlimited.co.uk/">Trustees Unlimited</a> matches organisations with those seeking trustee roles. Remember that many people will not understand what being a trustee involves and this is in fact one of the biggest barriers to people becoming trustees. Creating a role description to offer to potential candidates could help.<br />
                  <br />
                  How you appoint trustees will vary depending on your organisation's governance structures. But try to avoid adding any unnecessary hurdles. Formal interviews, for example, may deter some candidates.<br />
                  <br />
                  The process also doesn't end when you've appointed your new trustees. As well as making sure they understand their duties, ideally with formal training where necessary, make sure they meet key staff and other trustees and have plenty of time to learn about the organisation.<br />
                  <br />
                  Recruiting new trustees is – or should be – a significant undertaking. But the long-term rewards of a stronger board will make it a very worthwhile investment.<br />

              <td>Charities are under pressure to deliver more services but struggling due to funding reductions, research has shown<br />
                According to the latest, Managing in a Downturn survey report from PWC, The Institute of Fundraising and the Charity Finance Group, UK charities are in a "perfect storm".<br />
                <br />
                The research showed that 69% of charities are under pressure to deliver more services, but are clearly struggling in light of funding reductions. Many are facing an acute funding crisis. The report highlights that charities have experienced a net reduction in income across all funding streams, with 63% having been negatively affected by the government's spending cuts. It also says that 20% are considering a potential merger, and 28% are looking at reducing headcount, even though the sector saw about 70,000 job losses last year.
                Another coping strategy for some organisations is to step up fundraising efforts: 66% plan to increase fundraising activity, even though the majority of charities (93%) said the fundraising climate is tougher than ever, and 65% plan to expand into new areas.<br />
                <br />
                According to Cass Business School, charities lost £23m in assets during the downturn. The UK's biggest 500 fundraising charities saw their collective investment fund value drop by 21.4 per cent, while there was an 8.4 per cent decline in income received from charity investments.<br />
                <br />
                On a more positive note, we saw the launch of the £600m Big Society Capital fund to boost the social investment market earlier this year, and last month it announced details of its first investment – commitments of £37m to 12 organisations out of the 130 that had originally applied.<br />
                <br />
                However, with 171,000 registered charities in the UK, the funds are helping very few organisations in reality. Another problem is that many charities don't have the right people with the right skills to help them access these new funding streams and prepare them for this kind of investment.<br />
                <br />
                Another option for charities with trading arms is to hire non-executive directors (Neds) and/or trustees with specialist commercial experience who could help them trade out of this financial crisis while meeting their charitable objectives. Such individuals could also help to put their organisation in a better position to access these new funding opportunities.<br />
                <br />
                About half of charity and most of social enterprise income comes through trading, whether that is through running shops or through government contracts. Unsurprisingly, many charities understand that building this income could be the route out of this crisis. However, many are starting to recognise the need to hire commercial experts onto their boards.<br />
                <br />
                Over the past year, we have seen a demand on our services to help recruit Neds for various organisations, including charity trading subsidiaries and social enterprises. While they may sit alongside the trustees from the main board of the charity, they will focus purely on the commercial interests of the organisation. They will ensure the organisation is trading properly, that its financial interests are being well served, that it is being run in accordance with the law, and, most importantly, that it is generating profit. I'm sure that soon we will start to see a greater numbers of Neds being recruited specifically to help charities and social enterprises understand whether or not they can benefit from Big Society Capital.<br />
                <br />
                Another key aspect of the Ned role is as a contract negotiator. In our experience, Neds are less likely to have an emotional attachment to the charity than typical trustees and are, therefore, likely to be more effective negotiators who can secure good contract terms.<br />
                <br />
                However, just as charities struggle to find trustees from diverse backgrounds, it can prove even harder to find suitable Neds with the right commercial experience because such people tend not to be known within existing networks.
                We recently set up a new recruitment firm, Non-Executives Unlimited, as a sister arm to our trustee recruitment business, Trustees Unlimited. Through Non-Executives Unlimited, we can introduce organisations to a talent pool of 1,600 executives with senior-level experience gained in the public, private and civil society sector.<br />
                <br />
                We offer two recruitment services to suit social enterprises and charities with different budgets – a basic and standard service. However, one caveat is that any organisation recruiting a Ned needs to apply the same rigour as they would in trustee recruitment. If someone has an outstanding record in business but wouldn't fit in with the existing board, then don't hire them – it won't work.
                In a short space of time, we have recruited an Ned for the Women's Institute, a new chair of the Public Fundraising Regulatory Authority (PFRA) and the chair and a non-executive at The Barnet Group. We look forward to working with many more charities and social enterprises looking for Neds to help them through these tough times.<br />

              <td>Ian Joseph, chief executive of Trustees Unlimited and managing director – charities and not for profit, Russam GMS, discusses how becoming a charity trustee could help public sector workers gain new skills and motivation<br />
                <br />
                The public sector is facing one of its most challenging periods for a decade. Whilst the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics said that unemployment fell 46,000 in the three months to the end of June to total 2.56 million, with the unemployment rate down to 8.0 per cent from 8.1 per cent, the public sector is not faring so well.<br />
                <br />
                Figures for the last quarter from ONS show a nine year low with public sector jobs falling by 3.9 million between February and April 2012 to 5.9 million and there is no sign that this trend won't continue as the government continues to cut public sector jobs to try to save money, as well as continuing to promote private sector employment.<br />
                <br />
                Record numbers of public servants are out of work and life isn't much brighter for those in work with average earnings only increasing by 2.1 per cent in the year to April 2012, less than inflation at 2.8 per cent and many having to deal with a pay freezes. So what can public servants do to help them secure a new job in today's competitive job market should they find themselves in the unfortunate position of being made redundant? Equally, is there something people can do whilst in employment that enhances their skills and perhaps commensurate levels of motivation?<br />
                <br />
                One often overlooked way for people to gain new skills or enhance existing ones is by volunteering for a charity or becoming a trustee. We only need to look at the roles of the 70,000 volunteer "Games Makers" at the London 2012 Olympics to see what a fantastic contribution volunteering can make both to society and to the volunteers themselves.<br />
                <br />
                With over 170,000 UK charitable organisations ranging from large big brand charities to small organisations employing just a few people, there are many and varied opportunities for would-be volunteers looking to commit for a longer term as trustees.<br />
                <br />
                Public servants that are looking for work could boost their employability by volunteering and those that are working can gain a fresh perspective together with new and valuable skills in a completely different environment.<br />
                <br />
                Many charities, especially those that contract with government, look for people with public sector experience to join their boards as these people understand the machinery of government and can help demystify some of the thinking about working with the state.<br />
                <br />
                It is estimated that there are 950,000 trustee positions in the UK, so there are plenty of diverse and interesting opportunities for first timers. Most importantly, many charities are looking out for new trustees with an estimated one in five UK charities having at least one vacant position on their trustee board.<br />
                <br />
                Through holding a trusteeship people learn valuable skills, gain new experiences, make good contacts, enhance their CVs and at the same time contribute to society. This kind of experience can greatly enhance employability and could help those who find themselves made redundant secure their next job, especially if they are competing for jobs in the not for profit sector where experience of being a trustee is highly respected.<br />
                <br />
                Trusteeships however are not just for job seekers – serving on a charity board can give people valuable skills at any time in their careers; it offers an opportunity to give something back, learn about a different sector and make a difference. It can also be a life changing experience which can ultimately open the door to new career opportunities. It can also boost one's own levels of confidence which at a time when many are facing uncertainty about their job can only be a positive thing.<br />
                <br />
                It is important to note that being a trustee can be hard work and that it is a serious commitment. Being a trustee means that you have fiduciary and strategic oversight of the charity and the buck stops with the board. It is important therefore to understand the liabilities involved and undertake due diligence and research into an organisation before accepting a role.<br />
                <br />
                Here is some advice that potential trustees should seek clarity on before accepting a role:<br />
                <br />
                1. Be clear about the rules and responsibilities you are taking on – who can make the decisions and who can't?<br />
                2. What is the leadership style within the organisation? How good is the Chief Executive?<br />
                3. What is its strategic direction and business objectives?<br />
                4. What are the charities' resources? You need to include everything from the land it owns to intellectual property and trademarks<br />
                5. What are the training and induction processes for new trustees?<br />
                6. Every charity has a governance document containing rules for trustees. Make sure you see this at the outset, as it is your duty to comply with these rules and you be held responsible if you do not<br />
                7. What are the time commitments? Every charity will have different expectations<br />
                8. Understand who the beneficiaries are, as this is where the organisation's loyalty lies<br />
                <br />
                Although all these factors need to be considered carefully, there are some huge benefits and rewards in being a trustee and for many people, it can be a life changing experience or the route to a new career path. Given the uncertainty in the public sector at the moment, volunteering at a charity can also help gain some perspective on your current situation.<br />
                <br />
                Charities often want to attract people from diverse backgrounds, young and old, to inject energy and fresh ideas into their boards. Just remember to do your homework first and be aware of the challenges as well as the opportunities before taking on a trusteeship. If you do you will likely have one of the most rewarding experiences of your career to date. <br />

              <td>In the coming weeks, recruiters will be inundated with candidates including schools leavers and graduates, who are yet to secure their first jobs. According to a report from High Fliers, graduates are facing the worst job prospects for 20 years and around 80 candidates are applying for every graduate job. <br />
                <br />
                The job market is a ‘buyer’s market’ and while recruiters have a wider pool of candidate talent to choose from, there are fewer jobs and a greater number of people to disappoint — a double-edged sword.<br />
                <br />
                Another challenge for recruiters is the lack of differentiation between candidates. Many graduates have little work experience, and their understanding of the world of work and the skills needed by businesses is often limited. While recruiters can advise them on various training courses to improve their skills, we all know there is no substitute for work experience. <br />

                Trustees Unlimited, the joint venture recruitment company set up three years ago by Russam GMS, Bates, Wells Braithwaite and NCVO has just appointed its 100th trustee appointment - Deborah McCluskey to the board of Age UK Croydon firmly establishing it as a leading supplier of trustees to the civil society sector.<br />
                <br />
                Terry Roberts, the Chair of Age UK Croydon commented: “We are very pleased that Deborah is joining the board of Age UK Croydon. We are certain that she will both enjoy and be an excellent asset to the organisation in the months and years to come. We look forward to having her with us.”<br />
                Ian Joseph, Chief Executive of Trustees Unlimited says, “Over the past three years we have placed an eclectic mix of trustees, including several young trustees onto UK charity boards. Our trustees tend to be from professional backgrounds and are bringing a range of valuable skills and experience to UK charity boards to help improve their effectiveness.”
                “Diverse boards make better decisions, but the truth is many charities are still recruiting from within their own networks. Our recent research[i] showed that 45% of trustees are recruited through the existing networks, indicating that many charities are missing out on the best talent. Boards adopting this narrow approach to trustee recruitment run the risk of developing ‘group think’.”<br />
                <br />
                “Organisations with trustee vacancies should test the market. Even in cases where there are strong existing board members who perhaps wish to take the Chair role, it is good practice to put them through a competitive process and compare them with potential candidates from outside.”<br />
                <br />
                Ian Joseph’s tips for finding the best trustees<br />
                <br />
                Create a job description outlining not just what you want the person to do but the expected time commitments, location and times of meetings etc.<br />
                <br />
                Conduct an audit of the competencies, knowledge and/or experience needed for the role and recruit to that brief.
                Engage the whole board in the process.<br />
                <br />
                Think about why someone would be interested in coming to volunteer with you. You are passionate about the cause, but does your marketing material make a compelling proposition?<br />
                <br />
                Write a punchy advertisement!<br />
                <br />
                Prepare an information pack for candidates that include a link to the memorandum & articles of association, the accounts, biographies of your trustees, governance structure including sub committees and anything else that could be useful.
                Use social media to promote your opportunity.<br />
                <br />
                Consider using a professional recruitment firm with a track record of recruiting trustees.<br />
                <br />
                Be clear about who is making the decision. Is it the existing trustees or the membership? This needs to be clear upfront to avoid surprises later!<br />
                <br />
                Have a clear process for informal meetings, tours of services and interviews.
                Interviews should be evidenced based to test motivation as well as skills and experience. <br />
                Take references – always verbal.<br />
                <br />
                Have a good induction process in place.<br />
                <br />
                Pitfalls to avoid<br />
                <br />
                Rely on word of mouth<br />
                <br />
                Not disclose the true state of affairs, e.g. the reserves have run out! <br />

              <td>Social Enterprise UK sounds like a very good thing. Apparently there are 62,000 social enterprises in Britain , contributing £24bn to the economy and employing almost a million people. But many are struggling to recruit high quality trustees and non executives to their boards.<br />
                <br />
                So, even if you hanker after a plc board role, it may be sensible to look here first to get some experience.<br />
                <br />
                Non-Executives Unlimited has just been launched to recruit non-executive directors for the boards of charities with trading arms and social enterprises. It is a service launched by Trustees Unlimited, the joint venture recruitment business set up by Russam GMS, NCVO and Bates Wells Braithwaite.<br />
                <br />
                Ian Joseph, Director of Trustees and Non Executives Unlimited says: “The number of social enterprises in the UK is growing fast and many have vacancies for non execs. Social enterprises are businesses first and foremost and need to make a profit. Many are crying out for people with specialist skills and strong commercial experience to join their boards as non executive directors and help them grow.”<br />
                <br />
                It's the same old thing - or not, unless we change it. Mr Joseph adds: “Too many of these organisations are relying on word of mouth recommendations to source trustees and non execs and they are not getting people from diverse backgrounds who can offer the skills they need. Charities and social enterprises need to look outside their existing networks to find these people.” <br />
                <br />
                The company has recently recruited the new Chair of the Public Fundraising Regulatory Authority (PFRA) and the Chair and a non executive at The Barnet Group. <br />

              <td>A report published this month by the Commission on Youth Unemployment found that youth unemployment has reached an emergency point.<br />
                <br />
                With one in five young people not in employment, education or training and 250,000 unemployed for more than a year, the commission described it as one of the greatest challenges facing the country. It also said that the government faced a £28bn timebomb. Competition in the job market has never been tougher for young people and getting a foot on the career ladder has never been more challenging.<br />
                <br />
                This week is Student Volunteering Week – a time to celebrate the contribution young people make to good causes. It is also a time to encourage more students to volunteer and, in the current job market, there isn't a better time for young people to volunteer. Through volunteering, they will become more employable, learn vital new skills, gain work experience and make valuable contacts that could open the door to future job opportunities.<br />
                <br />
                A recent report published by Volunteering England highlighted that volunteering is already popular among students. 63% of students have volunteered for a charity since they started university and between them donated a total of just over 3m hours to communities in the 2009/10 academic year.<br />
                <br />
                However, one of the areas often overlooked by volunteers are the opportunities that exist within charities to join trustee boards. Just 2.1% of UK trustees are under 30 years of age, so young people are hugely under-represented on charity boards – something which many in the sector want to change.<br />
                <br />
                Some of the barriers to trusteeship for young people seem to be the fact they don't know enough about the trustee opportunities that exist and what it entails, or they don't feel they have accrued enough work experience or skills. On the contrary – many charities are crying out for young, motivated people who can demonstrate a willingness to learn and are passionate about a charity's ethos and goals. There are about 200,000 charitable organisations in the UK and one in five is likely to have a trustee vacancy – so there are many varied opportunities available.<br />
                <br />
                Becoming a charity trustee offers many benefits. Young people will learn how organisations are run and gain experience in areas such as setting strategic goals, accounting, financial planning and employment practice. Such experience would enhance any CV and give young trustees an edge over other jobseekers in an interview situation.<br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited was recently appointed as a preferred supplier of trustees to a number of students' unions together with Student Hubs. Several students have registered their interest however we want to encourage more people to sign up to help meet current demand from charities.<br />
                <br />
                We hope that Student Volunteering Week 2012 will prompt more students to consider becoming a trustee. It is not a decision to be taken lightly as it is a major commitment and comes with liabilities and responsibilities. We would advise any would-be trustee to do their homework first.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Here are my top considerations for anyone thinking of becoming a trustee:</strong><br />
                <br />
                1.	Be sure that this is really something you want to do. Do lots of research online about the pros and cons of being a trustee before making a decision.<br />
                <br />
                2. Volunteering England's website has lots of useful information on how to volunteer and how you can accredit your volunteering with UCAS points.<br />
                <br />
                3. Register your interest with Trustees Unlimited by visiting the website.<br />
                <br />
                4. Do your homework and find a charity you feel really passionate about. If you are going to dedicate a lot of time, you need to feel strongly about it.<br />
                <br />
                5. Be aware of the time commitments. Every charity will have different expectations. Make sure you can give it the time it requires but that there is still time available for you to look for full-time employment and attend interviews. Don't over-commit.<br />
                <br />
                6. The interview stage is crucial – it has to be a two-way conversation. This is the opportunity for you to get the information and answers you need to make the right decision. Ask what training and induction is provided for trustees at the outset.<br />
                <br />
                7. Every charity has a governance document containing rules for trustees. Make sure you see this at the outset as it is your duty to comply with these rules and you may be held responsible if you don't.<br />
                <br />
                8. Lastly, remember you will need to put the organisation first if there is a crisis or urgent need. As a trustee it is your duty to put the charity before other commitments.

                Trustees Unlimited, the joint venture recruitment business set up by Russam GMS, NCVO and Bates Wells Braithwaite has launched a new service, Non-Executives Unlimited, to recruit non-executive directors for the boards of charities with trading arms and social enterprises.<br />
                <br />
                According to Social Enterprise UK, there are 62,000 social enterprises in Britain currently, contributing £24bn to the economy and employing almost a million people. However, many are struggling to recruit high quality trustees and non executives to their boards.<br />
                <br />
                Ian Joseph, Director of Trustees and Non Executives Unlimited commented, “The number of social enterprises in the UK is growing fast and many have vacancies for non execs.

Charities and social enterprises need to look outside their existing networks to find these people,” he added.<br />
                <br />
                Richard Williams, Director of Enterprise and Development at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) said, "We have just published NCVO’s latest ‘Charity Forecast’ and 90% of survey respondents claimed they expected the voluntary sector’s financial fortunes to worsen over the next year. Interestingly, a third of charities also expect to increase the number of services they offer this year – they are going to need an injection of skills and support to achieve this. Many social enterprises are in effect the trading arms of charities and need talented independent non executive directors to help set strategy and to focus on the commercial objectives."<br />
                <br />
                Non-Executives Unlimited has a database of 1,500 senior level executives, many with commercial backgrounds from the public, private and civil society sector, who are looking to become non executives of social enterprises or join the boards of charity trading arms. The company provides trustee and non executive training for its candidates to ensure they are ‘board ready’ when they join an organisation. The company offers two services to suit social enterprises and charities with different budgets – a basic and standard service.
                The company has recently recruited the new Chair of the Public Fundraising Regulatory Authority (PFRA) and the Chair and a non executive at The Barnet Group. <br />

                That’s according to Ian Joseph, director of Trustees Unlimited, a trustee recruitment company run as a joint venture between the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), legal firm Bates Wells Braithwaite and interim recruiter Russam GMS.<br />
                <br />
                Joseph says: “Charities would benefit from the skills, energy, ideas and creativity that young people could bring to their boards.<br />
                <br />
                “However, it is not just the charities that would benefit; with 22% of young people currently unemployed, becoming a trustee could open doors to new contacts, enable them to gain valuable work experience and pick up skills that could be transferred into any future role.”<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Here are Joseph’s tips for those considering a charity trusteeship position: </strong><br />
                <br />
                •	find a charity you feel passionate about <br />
                •	understand who the charity’s beneficiaries are and what your responsibility and time commitments would be working for it <br />
                •	check that the organisation’s strategy and objectives match. <br /></td>

                Speaking last week at the joint venture trustee recruitment firm’s second anniversary celebrations in London, Joseph told Recruiter: “We are recruiting for a growing number of charities and social enterprises, and have also just been appointed as a preferred supplier to the National Union of Students — and we are looking forward to recruiting young trustees for UK charities.”<br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited was set up by Russam GMS, law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite (BWB) and the National Council for Voluntary and Community Organisations (NCVO) to help organisations struggling to recruit quality trustees and non-executives in a rigorous and cost-effective way.<br />
                <br />
                Joseph, who is also director, charities and not-for-profit practice, Russam GMS, added: “We set up Trustees Unlimited because we recognised that many organisations were finding it difficult to recruit outside their immediate networks and find new candidates.<br />
                <br />
                “Two years on, we have helped many organisations find trustees who can bring specific skills or experience who are now making a real impact.”
                Since it was established Trustees Unlimited has recruited over 40 trustees for UK charities. These include big brand names such as Christian Aid, Rethink and Age UK to smaller organisations including the Charity Employee Benevolent Fund, Beating Bowel Cancer and The Larches Trust, a charity established in 1995 by a group of families to create opportunities for people with learning disabilities and/or autism.<br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited has a database of over 1,300 trustee candidates and is in partnership with a number of other firms such as Centrica, BT and the NUS. <br />

              <td>Increasing pressure on social enterprises to trade their way to sustainability are forcing them to look for independent non-executive directors.<br />
                <br />
                With Trustees' Week upon us and the 2012 Olympics around the corner, many people in the UK are turning their attention to volunteering and looking at ways in which they can contribute to society. The coalition government's "big society" agenda is intending to reinvigorate Britain's philanthropic spirit by encouraging people to take a more active role in their communities, and has a vision of charities and social enterprises delivering a greater number of future public services and being more self-sufficient.
                But becoming a trustee is not the only option available; the fast-growing social enterprise space, in which businesses and charities trade for social and environmental purposes, holds plenty of opportunities and might appeal more to some people – perhaps those with a purely commercial background. While we estimate that one in five charities currently has a vacancy on their boards for a trustee, there are equally a great many social enterprises and charity trading subsidiaries crying out for experienced individuals who can bring specialist skills and commercial experience to their boards as non-executive directors.<br />
                <br />
                Currently 62,000 social enterprises exist in the UK, although, contrary to popular belief, many are charities and their wholly owned trading companies. Overall they contribute £24bn to the economy and employ around 800,000 people, and although this year there has been much excitement and debate about social enterprises and the "rise of the social entrepreneurs", there is nothing new about them. The first example of a social enterprise company can be traced back to 1840, when a Rochdale workers co-operative was set up to provide high-quality and affordable food for workers in response to poor factory conditions. And we only have to look at the success of charities such as The Big Issue, The Eden Project, The Sunlight Development Trust – a trading subsidiary of the Sunlight Centre Charity – or the many charities with retail arms such as Oxfam, Sue Ryder and RNIB, to recognise that, while this is a growing area, it is well-established and has its genesis in the charity sector.<br />
                <br />
                However, the government has thrust this sector – neatly defined recently by Lawrence Simanowitz, a partner at law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which specialises in this sector, as "the fourth way" – into the limelight this year.
                One of the government's big society missions is to make it easier for charities and social enterprises to compete with the private and public sectors to deliver public services in the future. It has made funding and support available for people starting social enterprises, and the upcoming public services bill – the private members' bill led by Chris White – suggests that commissioners will prioritise funding for organisations that offer genuine social change.
                It is also a confident sector. According to The state of social enterprises survey undertaken in November 2009, 48% of social enterprise companies were confident of future growth compared with just 24% of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in spite of the economic downturn. And, social enterprises also outperformed many SME companies during this period. An impressive 56% of social enterprises had increased their turnover from the previous year, compared to 28% of SMEs.<br />
                <br />
                So what opportunities exist for people to get involved with social enterprises and charity trading companies? Well, there are many. Social enterprises operate in almost every industry in the UK, from health and social care to renewable energy, retail through to sport, education and housing.<br />
                <br />
                But one important consideration for anyone thinking of joining the board of a social enterprise or a charity trading company is that they are businesses first and foremost – they need to make a profit in order to compete in the market, to ensure their survival and to invest in their social or environmental aims. So, like any good business, they will want to attract people with a diverse mix of skills and experience to their boards; people who can inject ideas, passion, creativity and who have the business knowledge and capabilities to help shape their future direction and ensure growth.
                Trustees of charities are there to act in the best interests of their beneficiaries, while directors of a social enterprise are there to act primarily in the interests of the shareholders. However, a director of a social enterprise will still be responsible for governance. They will still have to ensure that the social enterprise is financially solvent and meeting its financial goals as well as fulfilling its social mission. But, arguably, there may be fewer responsibilities and liabilities involved in joining a social enterprise or a charity trading company compared with trusteeship. Being a charity trustee has some other, obvious benefits and is often a stimulating, rewarding and interesting role – but it may not meet everyone's needs.<br />
                <br />
                In some cases, unlike trusteeship, people will be paid for their efforts in social enterprises. Those who work for Community Interest Companies or CICs – a new form of company created by legislation, but initially designed by Bates Wells Braithwaite specifically for social enterprises – can receive salaries, however people shouldn't expect large salaries and, if they do, they are joining for the wrong reasons.
                And, while the personal liabilities might be fewer, joining the board of a social enterprise is just as much of a commitment as becoming a trustee. Just as you wouldn't join a board of a business on a temporary basis, a social enterprise should be treated in exactly the same way if you want to make an impact on the business.<br />
                <br />
                In recent months, Trustees Unlimited has received a greater number of briefs from social enterprises, so we know there is demand out there for great people and exciting opportunities available. In fact, with increasing pressure on charities to trade their way to sustainability, many companies owned by charities are also looking for independent non-executive directors to complement the trustees who also sit on the board. So for people considering their options this Trustees' Week, it is important to remember there is a "fourth way".<br />

              <td><em>Ian Joseph from Trustees Unlimited offers some invaluable advice on the questions trustees must ask to ensure they are fully aware of what they are getting into:</em><br />
                <br />
                With over 170,000 UK charitable organisations, from large big brand charities to small organisations employing just a few people, there are many and varied opportunities for trustees. Contrary to the perception of many, the UK is a nation of volunteers. 25% of people volunteer at least once a month and four out of ten people volunteer at least once a year. There are an estimated 950,000 trustee positions in the UK, so there are plenty of diverse and interesting opportunities for first time trustees.<br />
                <br />
                An estimated one in five UK charities has at least one vacant position on their trustee boards and notably, there is an absence of young people. According to a Charity Commission report last year, young people are seriously under-represented on charity boards and less than 1% of under 25s are trustees. These figures need to change if we are to improve the robustness and effectiveness of charity boards, as the best boards tend to have a diverse mix of experience and age and reflect the makeup of society and their beneficiaries. <br />
                <br />
                With youth unemployment at a high and graduate unemployment specifically at its highest for many years, volunteering and trusteeship could be a very useful opportunity for young jobseekers to learn valuable skills, gain new experiences, make good contacts, enhance their CVs and at the same time contribute to society. Volunteering can encourage people to have a stake in their communities, something which has taken on extra significance in light of the recent disturbances across the country. <br />
                <br />
                In the past two years, we have seen a rise in the number of people from all walks of life, with diverse backgrounds and experience wanting to become trustees. This is hugely positive. However, before these people take the plunge, we advise them first of the many responsibilities that rest on the shoulders of a trustee. We are candid about the responsibilities and rewards involved, but also about the risks and the current funding challenges facing the not-for-profit sector, which is likely to impact their work. <br />
                <br />
                Any new trustee needs to be aware that funding is the biggest short term challenge for the sector this year, a factor borne out in NCVO's latest quarterly Charity Forecast which surveyed a range of charity leaders. In the report, the majority of charity leaders stated that their organisation's financial situation got worse last year and predicted it will get even worse over the next year. Almost all of them believe that economic conditions for the voluntary sector as a whole will be negative for the next 12 months. <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, the government's proposed changes to the commissioning of services under its big society agenda will leave many organisations struggling to adapt, so we counsel any would-be trustee to ask prudent questions about an organisation's governance, financial management and future growth plans. However, we also stress that during such a time of change, there will be exciting new opportunities for trustees who will be able to play a vital role shaping the future of organisations. <br />
                <br />
                Trustees are ultimately responsible for everything a charity does and can be held legally accountable for the decisions they make. Consequently, we urge people to understand the risks and liabilities involved in trusteeship and to undertake due diligence and research into an organisation before they accept a role. <br />
                <br />
                The interview stage is crucial - it has to be a two way conversation. This is the opportunity for candidates to get the information and answers they need to ensure they are making the right decision. <br />
                <br />
                Here is some advice and questions that trustees should ask before accepting a role: <br />
                <br />
                1. Be clear about the rules and responsibilities you are taking on – who makes what decisions? Where does the power lie, with the chief executive or the board? <br />
                <br />
                2. What is the leadership style within the organisation? Is the chair a team player? Does the chief executive respect the board? <br />
                <br />
                3. What is its strategic direction and business objectives? Is there a plan in place? Who drives it? <br />
                <br />
                4. What are the charities' resources? You need to include everything from the land it owns to intellectual property and trademarks. <br />
                <br />
                5. What are the training and induction processes for new trustees? <br />
                <br />
                6. Every charity has a governance document containing rules for trustees. Make sure you see this at the outset, as it is your duty to comply with these rules and you may be held responsible if you do not. <br />
                <br />
                7. What are the time commitments? Every charity will have different expectations. <br />
                <br />
                8. Remember, you will need to put the organisation first if there is a crisis or urgent need. As a trustee it is your duty to put the charity before other commitments – are the other board members committed to this? <br />
                <br />
                9. Understand who the beneficiaries are, as this is where the organisation's loyalty lies. <br />
                <br />
                10. Be very careful about the collective board decisions that are made. If you do not agree with a decision, you must register your dissent. If you are not at a meeting, read the minutes and make sure you have your say, it is your duty and responsibility. <br />
                <br />
                There are some huge benefits and rewards in being a trustee and for many people it can be a life changing experience or the route to new career path. UK charities are crying out for trustee talent and many want to attract young trustees from different backgrounds to inject some energy and fresh ideas into their boards. However, we would urge any new trustee to do their homework and be aware of the challenges and opportunities first before taking on a trusteeship. <br />

              <td><p> Mergers make an awful lot of sense in bleak financial times, says NCVO  director Richard Williams.<br />
                <br />
                The financial outlook may be bleak, but not all the news is bad - some  charities could benefit from greater collaboration, or even merging. <br />
                <br />
                To merge or not to merge – that is the question being asked around many  boardroom tables in UK charities. According to the preliminary findings of <a href="http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/leadership2020" title="">NCVO's Leadership 20:20 Commission</a> report,  funding is likely to be the number one concern of charity leaders this year.  What's more, they don't see the situation changing until at least 2020. In  light of this potentially bleak financial outlook, it is not surprising that  leaders are considering potential partnerships with other organisations,  including mergers and collaborations.<br />
                <br />
                As we know, some organisations like <a href="http://www.ageuk.org.uk/" title="">Help the Aged and Age Concern</a> have  taken the plunge already and have done so successfully. In addition, the last  couple of months have been awash with news of organisations stating their  intentions to merge. These have included <a href="http://www.poppyscotland.org.uk/index.php/homepage/show/home/poppyscotland" title="">Poppy Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/" title="">Royal  British Legion</a> as well as two of Scotland's oldest deaf charities, <a href="http://www.deafaction.org/" title="">Deaf Action</a> and <a href="http://www.taysidedeaf.org.uk/" title="">Tayside  Deaf Association</a>, a combination which will create the UK's largest  deaf charity.<br />
                <br />
                For organisations like these that share common goals, merging can make a  great deal of sense. There is strength in numbers, major cost savings to be  made and, if two organisations have similar charitable objectives and share the  same values and audiences, then there is often no better strategic option. If  they occupy the same space then a merger also cuts out the competition for  funds in this sector immediately.<br />
                <br />
                In any merger situation good governance is essential, and at such times,  the role of a trustee is incredibly important. It falls to the trustees to  ensure their organisation gets its governance right. Ultimately, it is their  responsibility to ensure that a merger is not only is the best option for the  charity strategically and culturally, but that it adheres to the charity's  objectives and the interests of its beneficiaries. This means prioritising  charitable objectives at all times throughout any merger process. It is down to  them also to analyse carefully if the merger is the right strategic move and  being driven by the right motivations, and not purely for financial reasons.  The cultural fit between the two organisations is equally important, and again,  it is the trustees' role to analyse this and if they have any misgivings or  objections they must communicate them.<br />
                <br />
                However, mergers aren't for everyone. There is significant resistance to  them within the sector. The recent <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/" title="">Charity  Commission's</a> third Economic Survey of Charities found that only 9%  of charities have considered merging, collaborating or forming a consortium  with another charity. However, this had increased by six percentage points on  the previous survey. Incidentally, regular surveys of <a href="http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/" title="">NCVO</a> members' confidence report much higher levels of anticipated collaboration, but  interest in mergers isn't a subject that is asked about.<br />
                <br />
                When we look at potential barriers and reasons why they are against  them, it is important to look at how civil society is comprised. Just 5% of the  170,000 UK charities have incomes of more than one million pounds and the  majority are very small organisations. Many of these charities operate as micro  businesses; they are run by few staff and often are small local charities. Such  charities tend to be embedded in their community and well known by everyone;  merging with another organisation would mean a loss of brand identity and this  could ultimately put the charity at risk.<br />
                <br />
                The civil society sector is no different to the private sector in terms  of how it responds to mergers. Any charity would fear being swallowed up by  another organisation, losing its identity and its brand image. They would be  concerned about the impact on their organisation, their people and fear that  under a new guise they might not be able to deliver their charitable  objectives.<br />
                <br />
                A more palatable alternative for charities is collaborative  partnerships. Collaboration can deliver huge benefits, efficiencies and cost  savings for both parties – whether that comes from sharing staff, office  premises, back office systems, pooling resources, jointly working on projects  or fundraising for a shared cause. Collaborating with the right partner can  deliver multiple benefits, not just in terms of cost savings. It can help  organisations develop; introduce new business methods and processes, new  technology and better ways of working. Employees and volunteers from within  both organisations can also learn from the expertise of each by working in  partnership.<br />
                <br />
                But even in collaborative partnerships, it is important for charities to  recognise that the responsibility still lies with the trustees to ensure good governance  and that the charitable objectives are met. No matter how small the  partnership, trustees must analyse the strategic impact on the organisation to  ensure that any working arrangement has the interests of the charities  beneficiaries at its core.<br />

              <td>Charities' persistent tendency to fill up their boards with their mates is holding back the sector's progress in producing more diverse boards, says Richard Williams.<br />
                <br />
                Women are still under-represented on the boards of top charities, according to new research from Charity Finance. With less than a third (31 per cent) of women on the boards of the top 100 charities, and with more than a quarter of these organisations having less than 25 per cent of women in their boardrooms, charities clearly need to work harder to improve boardroom diversity. <br />
                <br />
                While the charity sector is leading the private sector in terms of progressing women onto its boards, men still dominate the top jobs. Only 12 per cent of chairs are women, a surprisingly low figure given that the sector is such a large employer of women.  This research really begs the question: why are so few charities failing to prioritise the progression and positive contribution of women? <br />
                <br />
                One of the main reasons I believe is linked to the recruitment methods that still exist in many charities today, where trustees are recruited by word-of-mouth recommendations from within existing networks. Such practices are akin to the 'old boys' network' and ultimately limiting in a number of ways. It creates a lack of diversity on boards, limited perspectives around the boardroom table and at worst, skills and talent shortages that could hinder organisational development. <br />
                <br />
                In addition to these risks, the failure to progress more women onto boards of charities could have other organisational repercussions.  Lord Davies' recent report concluded there was a "clear business case" for increasing the number of women on boards. This follows a report from McKinsey which showed that companies with a higher proportion of women in senior positions were more likely to achieve greater stock-market growth. <br />
                <br />
                The recruitment of trustees was a big issue that was raised in the Institute of Philanthropy's study of trustee appointments, The State of UK Charity Boards, which found that around half of trustees are appointed through personal recommendations and just 20 per cent of charities advertised to fill their trustee vacancies. Clearly change is needed, particularly given the fact that almost one in five charities has a board vacancy. <br />
                <br />
                The report stated that boards need to work harder on trustee recruitment. I would agree with this view entirely. Organisations need to adapt their recruitment strategies to ensure they are attracting people with the best skills and experience, and this can only happen if they recruit from a diverse gene pool. Skills audits need to be undertaken regularly to evaluate if a board has the right mix of talent and skills that not only reflects the needs of their key stakeholders and beneficiaries, but will best position them to realise their business plans. <br />
                <br />
                Charities need to look outside their existing networks to recruit trustees and it doesn't have to be difficult or expensive. There are several free resources, such as social networking sites, which could be used to source talent. Additionally, NCVO's Trusteebank and our part-ownership of Trustees Unlimited is predicated around developing a rich diverse resource of potential trustees to enable charities and social enterprises to access a much wider selection of candidates. <br />
                <br />
                NCVO can also help to induct this rich vein of potential trustees and ensure that they are well versed in trustee responsibilities, and the culture and shape of the sector. This kind of training and development will ensure they become active and participative trustees more quickly and bring their skills and attributes to a well functioning, balanced and strategically-aware board. <br />

              <td>The jury is still out on how David Cameron's vision will affect not for profit companies, says Ian Joseph<br />
                The voluntary sector must work out how and why David Cameron's 'big society' will affect their work. <br />
                <br />
                At the "big society" re-launch earlier this month, David Cameron reaffirmed his commitment and passion for this ideology. However, in the not for profit sector it seems that the jury is still out in terms of what the big society is, how it will work and how it will affect them. What is clear is that boards need to adapt to the changing environment around them.<br />
                <br />
                While Cameron has spent months focusing on the idea of volunteering, as well as the importance of community groups and charities getting involved in the delivery of public services, he has also confirmed that local authority spending cuts will result in serious pain for many organisations. I met with a large service provider this week and they told me they are facing up to 18% cuts in their local authority funding. This will result in new contracts for staff with many now working longer hours for the same or less money. The reality of cuts is hitting home – hard.<br />
                <br />
                Cameron's intention to open up all public services to private contractors and voluntary organisations will mean opportunities and challenges to the sector in terms of winning work, and I hope that the sector will grow as it proves its ability to deliver. However, with more contracts comes increased accountability to the public for delivery. Furthermore, payment by results will be the modus operandi. Charities consistently rank near the top in terms of public trust but hard-fought reputations run the risk of exposure, as more contracts are awarded and the public demand excellence.
                The brave new world we are entering, whether willingly or not, means that the old world where boards were assembled in a less than robust way is, or rather, should be completely over. The sector embarked on a professionalisation journey some 20 years ago, but good governance is still very much a work in progress. As the sector docks at the quayside of the "big society" it needs to have boards in the bridge that are fit for purpose or run the risk of damage of titanic proportions. <br />
                <br />
                Governance is made all the more complex when the traditional structures of organisations are changing and where we have hybrid organisations, perhaps social businesses spun off from the state. It is vital that boards reflect the interests of the beneficiaries, rather than a particular stakeholder group such as employees or financial backers.<br />
                <br />
                One of the fundamental responsibilities of the board is to be the custodian of the organisation's vision, mission and values. As they adapt to the inevitable changes the big society will impose on them, boards needs to ensure they remain true to their purpose. That means that individual board members need to be engaged, attending meetings, reading reports before meetings and contributing. This sounds obvious but it's amazing how many boards are carrying dead weights. I sat in a two and a half hour board meeting recently and a fellow trustee did not say one word the whole time; what was she doing there? But having engaged board members is not enough. Not for profits should be undertaking a skills assessment to pinpoint any skills gaps regularly. <br />
                <br />
                My sense is that many boards will need to start recruiting individuals with strong commercial skills. Organisations will need to attract people from both the private and public sectors, and ideally those that have worked at the nexus of all three sectors. They may also need to improve the skills of existing board members and invest in training – particularly in the areas of governance and finance.
                Organisations will also have to consider if their boards are diverse enough; if they are balanced and truly reflective of the people they serve. This is not about tokenism, but rather about ensuring the board is as possible close to the market it serves. 
                Christian Aid and London-based mental health charity Community Options are two organisations which have recently used Trustees Unlimited's recruitment services to find trustees from diverse backgrounds. Christian Aid recruited Tom Hinton, a finance director of one of Centrica's businesses, because it wanted to strengthen its financial and risk management capabilities. <br />
                <br />
                Community Options recruited John Schuster, a marketing communications expert with a financial background, to its board to help raise the organisation's profile and highlight its work in mental health. Both organisations and many like them have wrestled with what they need and then gone out and found them (often with a little help from a professional recruitment firm). This must be the correct way to help our organisations be relevant.<br />
                <br />
                One in five charities have at least one vacancy on their boards. Given that there are gaps on boards and gaps in skills, now is the perfect time to grab hold of our boards and fill those vacant positions with top-quality people who can help us all prepare for the journey ahead. <br />

              <td><strong>While not for profit organisations are being encouraged to deliver more public services, many don't have the knowhow to cope with the new demands - could recruiting more diverse trustees be the answer?</strong><br />
                <br />
                The new coalition government has pledged to place the civil society sector at the heart of its 'Big Society' programme. <br />
                <br />
                Part of its aim, as it devolves power to people, is for not for profit organisations to work more closely with the state and compete with public sector organisations to deliver a greater number of public services.<br />
                <br />
                These are ambitious plans for a sector that is famously under resourced. Some charity leaders have expressed doubts already about the ability of smaller charities to cope with such pressures, questioning if they have the knowhow and resources available to adopt such a role.<br />
                <br />
                There is little doubt the sector is facing an unprecedented level of change and uncertainty and many organisations are suffering still from the impact of the recession and feel threatened by the planned public sector cuts. <br />
                <br />
                In this climate, strong governance and leadership is essential. Recent research from both PricewaterhouseCoopers and interim management provider, Russam GMS highlighted that better financial management and governance is now a top priority for charities and considered vital to get them through these difficult times.<br />
                <br />
                Now is the time for organisations of all sizes to strengthen their boards to ensure they are led by the people who will ensure they have a sustainable future. <br />
                <br />
                A diverse range of trustees <br />
                <br />
                The best boards will include a diverse range of trustees – people from different industry and functional backgrounds with a range of skills, talent, knowledge and experience, which will ensure they make the best decisions about the future of the organisation.<br />
                <br />
                But finding such individuals has been a long standing challenge for the sector, and consequently, there has been an over reliance on personal networks in the past, resulting in boards recruiting in their own likeness.<br />
                <br />
                Some organisations have however, recently tackled this problem by investing in a trustee recruitment service, like Trustees Unlimited, to enable them to tap into a wider pool of potential trustees, ensure trustees are rigorously vetted and that their skills are assessed.<br />
                <br />
                Christian Aid recently enlisted our help to find a new financial expert to join its trustee board. It needed a qualified accountant with strong risk management skills on its board and the tough economic climate, coupled with its desire to expand internationally had highlighted this skills gap. <br />
                <br />
                The organisation had tried several channels to find such a trustee; including using its own network of individuals, but none had produced the right person.<br />
                <br />
                Through Trustees Unlimited, it appointed Tom Hinton, the financial controller of British Gas who as well as being a Christian, is just 30 years old. <br />
                <br />
                Christian Aid sees Tom as a 'breath of fresh air' and hopes that his dynamic approach and strong commercial experience will strengthen its financial and risk management capabilities.<br />
                <br />
                The recruitment service is not just aimed at larger organisations with bigger budgets. <br />
                <br />
                Community Options is a small London-based charity that provides services and accommodation for people with mental health needs. Through us, it recently appointed John Schuster, a marketing expert to its trustee board to raise the organisation's profile and brand and to input into its five year strategic plan. <br />
                <br />
                John has a 20-year track record of delivering marketing campaigns to financial services companies and Community Options is now confident it has the right level of marketing expertise on its board to build its profile successfully.<br />
                <br />
                For too long charities have struggled to recruit the best talent to their boards, and with such uncertainty and change in the sector, this problem can no longer be overlooked.<br />
                <br />
                There are plenty of talented people in the market who want to serve as trustees and we are providing a cost-effective recruitment service that will bring trustee/non executive talent into small and large third civil society organisations. <br />
                <br />
                In time, we hope this will help to improve the governance across the whole sector.<br />
                <br />

              <td><strong>Small charities need skilled leaders to guide them through difficult economic times but finding and recruiting the right people can be problematic. A new specialist trustee recruitment service could help.</strong><br />
                <br />
                Small voluntary and community organisations never fail to impress me with their ability to instinctively know how to get more "bang for their buck" when it comes to stretching money for frontline services. Their passion and enthusiasm for their cause means they consistently deliver high quality services under the most challenging of circumstances.<br />
                <br />
                While funding is obviously important, the success of any voluntary and community organisation, regardless of its size, is down to the way in which it is governed and led. Funders are increasingly expecting voluntary and community organisations to demonstrate their impact and accountability and expect to see business plans and diversity strategies as part of funding applications. <br />
                <br />
                The recession and impending public sector cuts mean we are facing lean years as a sector and all organisations will need skilled leaders, more than ever, to guide us through this difficult period.<br />
                <br />
                More than a million people are already charity trustees, responsible for everything their organisation does. Yet the role of charity trusteeship is sorely under recognised and many charities – particularly smaller ones – have problems finding and recruiting the right people.<br />
                <br />
                Almost half of all voluntary and community organisations say they are finding it more difficult to recruit now than they did five years ago.<br />
                <br />
                For smaller organisations with few or no paid staff, this can place even greater demands on individual trustees who may be expected to take on a number of roles beyond that of governing the organisation.<br />
                <br />
                NCVO, together with law firm Bates, Wells Braithwaite and interim management recruitment consultancy Russam GMS, has now launched a specialist trustee recruitment service for small charities, through company Trustees Unlimited. The service enables organisations to tap into candidates with a wide range of backgrounds and experience, filling skills gaps and thereby strengthening boards.<br />
                <br />
                Our advice is that voluntary and community organisations need to take trustee recruitment as seriously as they would staff recruitment. Organisations should look beyond their immediate networks and reach out to a wide group of people as potential trustees. <br />
                <br />
                Historically, many organisations have relied on "word of mouth" to recruit their trustees and this obviously limits the pool of interest for trustee roles and can mean they do not recruit people with the skills and experience they require to govern effectively. <br />
                <br />
                This, of course, poses particular issues for smaller organisations where budgets are extremely tight and spending money on anything other than direct delivery of services can appear to be wrong.<br />
                <br />
                One London-based voluntary organisation told us: "<em>We don't really have a budget line for governance. We've got one for trustee meetings – for sandwiches and so on – does that count?</em>"<br />
                <br />
                If as a sector we want to ensure that we speak with even greater authority when representing our most marginalised communities, we need to invest in trustee recruitment and recognise that finding and keeping trustees is a vital task for all voluntary and community organisations. <br />
                <br />
                I hope that our new service is an affordable way of making this process easier for smaller charities, that have so much to gain from getting leadership right.<br />

                <br />
                The new, cost effective service is an extension of Trustees Unlimited's existing trustee recruitment offerings. It has been set up in response to significant demand from organisations with a turnover of less than £500K who want to access the growing numbers of professional people wanting to serve as trustees who are registered with Trustees Unlimited. <br />
                <br />
                This basic version of the Trustees Unlimited recruitment service will be available for a one off fee of £750. It will include a briefing conversation with the selection committee of the recruiting organisation to ensure clarity on the type of trustee required and a search of suitable candidates from the Trustees Unlimited database of around one thousand people. <br />
                <br />
                Ben Kernighan, Deputy Chief Executive, NCVO says, "<em>Leadership is a crucial area that all charities, regardless of their size, must get right if they want to ensure their long-term success so finding and recruiting the right trustees is a hugely important task. Trustees Unlimited has already successfully placed trustees in larger organisations and I'm delighted we are expanding the service so smaller charities can access high calibre candidates at affordable prices.</em>" <br />
                <br />
                Ian Joseph, Head of the Not for Profit Practice at Russam GMS added, "<em>Trustees Unlimited is committed to good governance in the sector. We want to make it easier for every not for profit organisation in the UK to recruit high quality trustees and this new inclusive and accessible service will make that possible.</em>" <br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited was established to help not for profit organisations solve the difficult challenge of trustee recruitment and recruit talented and professional trustees more easily. Research from NCVO highlighted that 43% of boards find it more difficult to recruit trustees today than five years ago; 81% of charities rely on word of mouth recommendations to recruit trustees which can limit the talent pool, and 76% of trustees are over 45 years old which means that charities need to think about succession planning to replace them when they retire. <br />
                <br />
                Since its launch, over 1,000 professionals looking for trustee roles have signed up to Trustees Unlimited; there has been significant demand for trustees from not for profit organisations of all sizes and several trustee placements have been made in large not for profit organisations, such as Christian Aid, through to smaller organisations such as London based, Community Options. </td>

                Ben Kernighan, Deputy Chief Executive, NCVO said: "Leadership is a crucial area that all charities, regardless of their size, must get right if they want to ensure their long-term success so finding and recruiting the right trustees is a hugely important task. <br />
                <br />
                "Trustees Unlimited has already successfully placed trustees in larger organisations and I'm delighted we are expanding the service so smaller charities can access high-calibre candidates at affordable prices." </td>

              <td><strong>Economic woes are pushing board members and trustees to take on stronger leadership roles so ensure the future stability of charitable organisations.</strong><br />
                <br />
                <strong>Private sector expertise meets public sector dedication: chairman Ramez Sousou and chief executive Shaks Ghosh of the Private Equity Foundation. </strong><br />
                <br />
                Almost 1 million trustees steer a combined income of £36bn from around 190,000 organisations in England and Wales, but the public remains largely unaware of their work. The low profile held by the trustees and board members of the not-for-profit sector belies their enormous responsibility, as figures from independent regulator the Charity Commission show.<br />
                <br />
                A trustee is a member of the trust or board which takes ultimate legal responsibility for a charity's work, ensuring it is run in line with the aims of the organisation. Generally unpaid, the role involves attending several meetings a year, acting in the best interests of the charity, while day-to-day tasks are covered by staff and volunteers. However, the banking crisis and recession has drawn attention to failures in the governance of financial institutions and led other sectors, including the charity sector, to focus on its own management issues. This, in addition to competition for contracts to deliver public services, demands much more dynamic leadership from trustees.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Prepared for the future</strong><br />
                <br />
                "The recession has made clear that, now more than ever, charities need good strategic leadership and the ability to mitigate risk and seize opportunities," says Ralph Michell, head of policy at the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo). Ben Kernighan, deputy chief executive at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), says the ability to develop strategy, deal with human resources or collaboration and merger issues are also important.<br />
                <br />
                With the public sector braced for cuts, demand for charity services will increase and organisations will face tough decisions about carving up scant resources. Charities should therefore be thinking much more about what skills they want their trustees and board members to have – financial expertise might be one desirable quality.<br />
                <br />
                The sector has a code of good governance, drawn up by umbrella bodies, such as Acevo and NCVO, in 2005. However, according to a report published last May by consultants New Philanthropy Capital, charities do not always prioritise governance. According to the report, Board Matters: A Review of Charity Trusteeship in the UK, recruitment, training and evaluation of board members is neglected. The report also underlines the low-profile status of trustees – 95% of people in the UK, according to the report, are unaware that they can support a charity by becoming a trustee.<br />
                <br />
                Recruitment is a huge challenge. The Charity Commission estimates that about half of all charities have at least one board vacancy, with the most common recruitment method being through friends or via existing board members.<br />
                <br />
                A handful of organisations exist to help charities find trustees. These include the Trusteefinder service from the Charity Trustee Network, TrusteeWorks run by volunteering charity Reach and third-sector recruitment consultancy Prospectus, and the NCVO's Trustees Unlimited service.<br />
                <br />
                According to the Charity Commission report, Trustee Recruitment, Selection and Induction, a failure to focus on recruitment creates problems with governance. "Often, difficulties result from trustees not knowing or understanding their responsibilities, or not having access to basic information about the charity's structure and remit."<br />
                <br />
                However, many in the sector feel it is misleading to talk of a recruitment crisis because the real issue is that of quality, not quantity. Michell says: "There's no ideal number to have on the board – it's more about making sure you do have the right mix of skills, experience and links."<br />
                <br />
                A high-quality board should be diverse, but the commission estimates that 76% of trustees are aged 45 or over, hence the prevailing stereotype of trustees being white, well-heeled and  retired.<br />
                <br />
                Yet it can be hard to balance the need for board members who boast professional skills with the need to involve members of the community and create a truly diverse board. Community representatives or service users encouraged into the boardroom might lack the experience and confidence to grapple with complex decisions. One answer, says Michell, is to involve people in ways other than being on the board, through forums that feed back to the board.<br />
                <br />
                Private-sector experience<br />
                <br />
                Professional diversity is also important. Shaks Ghosh, former head of homelessness charity Crisis, says trustees with private-sector experience have a lot to offer. Ghosh, who is now chief executive of the Private Equity Foundation (PEF), a cross-industry body that invests in youth educational charities, says: "Trustees see the business behind the charity as well as the need that it is striving to meet. Inevitably there's a focus on efficiency and sustainability."<br />
                <br />
                A typical example of this type of key advisory role is that filled by the PEF's chairman, Ramez Sousou, founder and joint chief executive of international private equity and investment firm TowerBrook Capital Partners. Ghosh values Sousou's private-sector experience and business perspective, and insights derived from his seat on numerous corporate boards and his work as a trustee with the NSPCC.<br />
                <br />
                One way to recruit a good mix of trustees is by paying them, thereby encouraging those who cannot afford to take on unpaid work. However, many feel that compensating board members and trustees tarnishes the ethos of the charitable sector. Currently, third-sector organisations cannot pay trustees without suitable authority, either in their governing document, from the commission or the court.<br />
                <br />
                Acevo's Michell says: "You'd not think twice about paying staff, but we've an aversion to paying those charged with steering an organisation through a recession." Joe Saxton, founder of NFP Synergy, says: "You've paid chief executives of charities espousing no payment for trustees. It's ironic. Why the difference?" Acevo's governance reform group supports members aiming to change governance arrangements, which include payment of trustees.<br />
                <br />
                So what shape might the ideal board or trust take? Saxton says organsiations should be "smaller, fitter but bigger in impact". Basically, says Michell, boards must understand their roles better. "Governance is actually about ensuring the delivery of the organisation's purpose."<br />
                <br />
                The NCVO urges boards to think more long-term about their organisation's future, especially at this time of greater uncertainty. "Boards and trusts are invisible," says Ghosh. "We do not need much radical change, but we do need them to have more visibility." </td>

                <br />
                While all not for profit organisations need a trustee board, many struggle to find people with the relevant skills and experience. NCVO research highlighted that 43% of boards find it more difficult to recruit trustees today than five years ago; 81% of charities rely on word of mouth recommendations to recruit trustees which can limit the talent pool, and 76% of trustees are over 45 years old, so some charities may struggle to replace trustees when they retire. <br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited will address the shortfall offering an extensive range of high calibre, trustee candidates with a broad range of experience covering the private, public and third sectors. The recruitment process will involve a meeting with the Chair or senior trustees to take a detailed brief before suitable trustees are selected. All trustees will be interviewed and have references checked before being shortlisted for client interviews. The company aims to deliver a shortlist to its clients just 10 days after taking the initial brief.<br />
                <br />
                Ben Kernighan, Deputy Chief Executive, NCVO said: "Getting governance right should be a very high priority for all organisations. Our research shows that many organisations have trustee vacancies and struggle to find trustees with the right skills. The best boards are diverse, coming from a wide range of backgrounds and bringing a broad range of skills and perspectives. Trustees Unlimited will play an important role in helping organisations recruit the trustees that are right for them.

                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited is a joint venture set up by the National Council for Voluntary Orgainsations (NCVO), Bates Wells Braithwaite (BWB), a leading firm of solicitors for the charity and not-for-profit sector, and interim management provider Russam GMS.<br />
                <br />
                Combining the joint contacts of the three organisations, including Russam's database of 10,000 interims, Trustees Unlimited aims to source a wider variety of future trustees for the UK's 150,000 plus charities, many of which struggle to find volunteers with the relevant skills and experience.<br />
                <br />
                Peter Bennett from BWB told Recruiter at the launch: "There are 1m charity trustees in the UK and their age and diversity profile is not changing. One of the aims of Trustees Unlimited is to source a new profile of trustee."<br />
                <br />
                Ben Kernighan, deputy chief executive of NCVO, added that becoming a trustee "is a great way for younger people, especially, to develop their skills and raise their own profile, as well as contributing to the charity".<br />
                <br />
                Russam's head of charity/not-for-profit practice, Ian Joseph, told Recruiter: "An effective board is a diverse board. People really want to get involved. In the first week of the website going live, we have had 700 people registering to become a trustee already."<br />
                <br />
                Russam will carry out the initial vetting and sifting of suitable applicants for a charity. The costs and terms of business are shown on the website, which aims at the middle-range and above charities.<br />
                <br />

              <td><strong>Charities must endeavour to create inclusive and diverse boards and while finding new suitable trustees is important, equally the commitment by those already contributing to their communities needs to be recognised.</strong><br />
                <br />
                The debate about the future of the voluntary sector is often about funding and resources, obscuring the crucial area of leadership that charities must get right if they want to weather the impact of the recession and build a sustainable future.<br />
                <br />
                There are already one million charity trustees who regularly contribute to their communities and help form the backbone of civil society. They are ultimately responsible for everything their organisation does and yet this is a sorely under-recognised role.<br />
                <br />
                There is limited public awareness that becoming a trustee is a great way to make a difference to communities and gain new skills in working strategically, dealing with finance as well as honing interpersonal skills – all of which are recognised and highly valued by employers.<br />
                <br />
                With the recession and impending cuts in the public sector, demand for charity services is going to increase and many charities are going to face tough decisions about how to allocate limited resources, making the role of trustees – and the job of finding them – even more important. <br />
                <br />
                Yet it is increasingly difficult for charities to find suitable people for these posts with 43% of voluntary and community organisations stating they find it more difficult to recruit trustees now than they did five years ago.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>An ageing trustee population</strong><br />
                <br />
                Compounding this problem is an ageing trustee population with 76% over the age of 45 while less than 1% of trustees are under 25 and the fact that only 5% of trustees are from a black, minority or ethnic backgrounds. <br />
                <br />
                This means many trustee boards are not representative of the communities they exist to serve.<br />
                <br />
                Currently, 80 per cent of charities use word-of-mouth to recruit trustees, meaning they often fail to recruit at all or fail to get the right mix of people and skills they need.<br />
                <br />
                There are many possible reasons for this shortage and lack of diversity but the sector must take ownership of this problem and address it. The National Council for Voluntary Organisation's (NCVO) 'Get on Board' campaign proved it is possible to engage younger and more diverse audiences by using a range of measures including new technology such as text messages and targeting ethnic and specialist media. <br />
                <br />
                The sector must invest in this process to make it successful and it must make a commitment to changing the culture of boards.<br />
                <br />
                Ensuring voluntary organisations have diverse boards is not just about getting a good mix in terms of gender, age and race. <br />
                <br />
                It's also about having people with a range of work and life backgrounds and the strongest boards bring together people with this diversity of experience.<br />
                <br />
                From this week, charities will be able to use a new specialist trustee recruitment service run collaboratively by NCVO, law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite and interim management recruitment consultancy Russam GMS.<br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited offers a professional and cost-effective service to recruit people from across the, private, public and voluntary sectors.<br />
                <br />
                All candidates will be interviewed and reference checked to ensure they offer the right combination of skills, experience and diversity.<br />
                <br />
                All charities need to work hard to create more inclusive and diverse boards. These will bring fresh perspectives to the ways organisations are governed and led and be more responsive to the communities they exist to serve.<br />
                <br />
                That said, while it's clear we must step up our efforts to find new trustees, we must not forget to celebrate and promote the work of those who already have made this commitment and whose efforts make a vital contribution to communities and neighbourhoods across the country.<br />

                A new trustee recruitment service will charge charities up to £5,500 to find and train board members who are not the "usual suspects".<br />
                <br />
                Trustees Unlimited, which is launched today, is a joint venture by umbrella body the NCVO, law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite and interim management agency Russam GMS.<br />
                <br />
                It offers to draw up and interview a long list of candidates and then present its client charity with a shortlist of five. If the charity chooses one, it will be charged between £3,000 and £5,000, depending on its income. Inducting the new board member will cost another £500.<br />
                <br />
                Stephen Lloyd, the senior partner at BWB who came up with the idea, said it would plug the gap between free lists of trustees and expensive recruitment agencies. He said Russam GMS's database of 10,000 interim managers, which the service will draw on, constituted a "new gene pool" of trustees who were not the "usual suspects".<br />
                <br />
                "I am a trustee of five organisations, but I often get people ringing me up asking me to be a trustee for them," he said. "I thought that there must be a better way of finding trustees than asking me." </td>
