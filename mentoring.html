  <div class="box_body_gradient"><span class="purpleheading">Mentoring</span><br />
    <br />
    Non-Executives Unlimited offers a mentoring service for individuals on boards. Many individuals, especially those new to board membership or Chairs, find mentoring an extremely helpful tool. A mentor is a very experienced individual who will meet with the mentee at regular intervals over an agreed period to discuss with them the challenges and issues they face. <br />
<br />We help broker the relationship between mentor and mentee and provide quality assurance to ensure that the relationship is adding real value. The numbers of sessions are dictated by the mentee and there is no minimum number.
<br />
<br />
We have a small pool of trained and experienced mentors and their details are below.
