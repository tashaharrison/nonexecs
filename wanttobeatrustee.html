    <br />
    Social Enterprises will be at the vanguard of helping to deliver the Big Society but good governance will be crucial if this is to happen.<br />
<br />

Many people secure one or more non-executive or trustee appointments as part of a portfolio approach. Often they are still in employment at senior levels.<br />
<br />

The best time to start looking for non-executive work is when you are still working and on someone's payroll. Oftentimes you need to get the blessing of your line manager and of your current organisation. It needs to be seen that diverting a small part of your time and effort would work to the benefit of your company and you need to handle this persuasion process with skill. Different companies have different views on this, ranging from those who have never considered it to those who have formal and structured arrangements. A growing number of organisations are adopting these as an enlightened approach to outplacement and a kindly element in the employment contract. Being fairly close to your line manager helps. 
<br />
<br />You need to think about why you want to be a non-executive and you need to have the skills, knowledge, background and temperament to bring something valuable to the organisation – otherwise why would they want you? You need to invest in developing your professional attractiveness and ability to be seriously useful. Remember, there is much more supply than demand. You also need to be aware of the statutory obligations and, importantly, the risks. Deciding to join a social enterprise as a non-executive is as important a decision for you as it is for the company. You should seriously approach the process of acquiring as much information and views of others as you can – and keep the process going. Search the internet. Read as much as you can find. Talk to people who have successful records as non-executives. Treat your existing knowledge and skill base as a platform, not as a qualification.

 <span class="blueheading">How can I register my interest with Non-Executives Unlimited? </span><br />
<br />


If you would like to register with us, please <a href="forms/Nonexecutives_Registration.php">click here</a>. Should the right opportunity come up, you will be contacted and asked whether you are interested in applying. If you are, we will normally ask you to make a formal application. You may then be asked to attend a preliminary interview with a consultant from Non-Executives Unlimited. Candidates short listed by the recruiting organisation will then be taken through whatever process the organisation wishes to deploy but normally this is an interview with the nominations committee, a meeting with the Chief Executive/visit to the organisation and a meeting with the other board members.<br />
